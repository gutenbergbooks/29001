<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE MAN IN THE MOON.</h3>


<div class='blockquot2'><p><span class="smcap">Children</span>, down on the planet which
you call Earth, allow me to introduce myself
to you! I am the Man in the Moon. I have
no doubt that you know a good deal about me, in
an indirect way, and that your nurses have told you all
sorts of nonsense about my inquiring the way to Norwich&mdash;as
if I didn't know the way to Norwich! and
various things equally sensible. But now I am going to
tell you a little about myself, and a great deal about <i>yourselves</i>,
and about everything in general. In short, I am
going to write you a book, and this is the beginning of it.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class='blockquot3'><p>You see, I live very quietly up here, very quietly indeed, with only
my dog to bear me company. He is a good dog, and very funny
sometimes, but still I have a good deal of time on my hands, and
nothing amuses me so much as to watch all that is going on down on
your planet, and see what people in general, and children in particular,
are doing, every day and all day. You may wonder how I can
see so far, and see distinctly, but that is easily explained. I have a
great, monstrous mirror, which is&mdash;oh! well, if I were to tell you how
big it is, you would not believe me, so I will only say that it is very
big indeed. This mirror has also the advantage of being a very
strong magnifying glass, and as I can tip it in any direction I please,
you will easily understand that I can see just what is going on in any
part of the world that I happen to be interested in. For instance,
Tommy Tiptop, the glass was tipped towards New York this morning,
and I saw you take away your little sister's stick of candy, you greedy
boy! Yes, and I saw you put in the closet for it, too, so that was
well ended. Children are the same, I find, all the world over, for it
was only yesterday that a little boy in Kamschatka (an ugly little
Tartar he is, and not so very unlike you), named Patchko, while his
father was out hunting, took away a tallow candle from his sister,
which seemed just as good to her as the barley sugar did to little
Katie.</p></div>

</div>

<p>But, children all, I beg your pardon! I am not writing this book
for Tommy Tiptop, and I hope that most of the boys who read it will
be better than he is. I do want, however, to tell you about some
children of whom I am very particularly fond, and whom most of you
do not know. These children live in the town of Nomatterwhat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which, as you are probably aware, is in the State of Nomatterwhere,
which again is, or really ought to be, one of the United States of
America. Perhaps these are Indian names; similarly, perhaps they
are not. There are five of these children, and I call them my Five
Mice; and the queer house that they live in I call the Mouse-trap.
They are such funny
children! I watch
them sometimes all
day long, their pranks
are so amusing; and
then when night
comes, I slide down a
moonbeam and sit by
their pillows, and tell
them stories and sing them songs. Ah! they like that, you may
believe! And you all shall hear the stories and songs too, if you
like, for I will write them down. So now, children all, listen! in
America, Jennie and Johnny; in France, Marie and Emil; in Germany,
Gretchen and Hans; in Italy, Tita and Nanni; in Kamschatka,
Patchko and Tinka. Listen all, great and small, to the old</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE MOUSE-TRAP.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/gs006.jpg" width="185" height="300" alt="Cottage" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago, <i>very</i> many years as you would think, though the
time seems short enough for me, there came to the little village
(as it then was), of Nomatterwhat, an old man. He was a very
queer old man, and nobody knew where he came from, or anything
about him, except what he told them himself; and that was very little
besides the fact that his name was Jonas Junk, that he had come to
Nomatterwhat because he chose to come, and that he would stay
exactly as long as it pleased him and no longer. The good people
of the village, finding him such a very gruff and crusty old fellow,
thought it best to let him alone; and this being exactly what old
Jonas Junk wanted, he was well satisfied. Apparently what he
wanted beside was to build a house for himself: at all events, that
is what he did. He bought a large piece of ground and built a high
wall all round it, and put the ugliest and most vicious looking iron
spikes that you can imagine all along the top of the wall. Then he
chose the sunniest and most sheltered spot he could find on the
place, and there the old man built his house. Well, to be sure, what
a queer house it was! in the first place, there were three separate
flights of stairs, one for old Jonas himself, one for his cat, and one
for his dog. His own staircase was very easy, with broad low steps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and two landings, though the distance was very short from the first
story to the second; but the poor cat and dog must have had a hard
time of it. The other two staircases were so crooked it seemed as
if the carpenter must have built them in his sleep, and have had the
nightmare to boot. Each step was set
at a different angle from the one below
it; and they were high, and steep,
and dark&mdash;ugh! I don't like to
think about them. I remember I tried
to send a moonbeam down the cat's
stairs once, through a little skylight
over the landing; and the poor thing
got lost and wandered about for an
hour before it could find its way back
again. There's a flight of stairs for
you! and everything else in the house
was just as queer. There were large
rooms and small rooms, long rooms
and square rooms; there were cupboards everywhere, you never saw
so many cupboards in your life. Some close to the floor so that you
bumped your head in looking into them, others so high up in the
wall that nothing short of a step-ladder could reach them; cupboards
in the chimneys, and cupboards under the stairs; yes, there was no
end to them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/gs007.png" width="322" height="400" alt="Grapes" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, Jonas Junk furnished his house, and there he lived for many
a year, with his dog and his cat, and nobody else. All the ground
about the house he made into a beautiful garden, full of pear trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and apple trees and all kinds of fruit trees. People used to say, by
the way, that the reason these apple trees were so crooked, was
because they tried to look like old Jonas himself; but I don't know
how that was.
Certainly, Jonas
was not a beauty,
and I am sorry
to say the boys
were disposed to
make fun of
him whenever he
ventured out of
his queer house
into the village.
"But what has
all this to do
with mice and a
mouse-trap, you
ask?" Patience!
patience! we are
coming to that
very soon. I am
an old man, older than all of you and all your great-grandmothers
put together, so you must let me tell my story in my own way. If
Jonas Junk had lived on till to-day, his house would never have
been turned into a mouse-trap; but one dark night, you see,
he fell down the dog's stairs and broke his neck, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was an end of him. For a long time nobody lived in his house, and
the garden was all going to rack and ruin, when one fine day a gentleman
from a neighboring town came to see the old house and took
a great fancy to it;
and finally he
bought it, cat-stairs,
dog-stairs,
cupboards, garden
and all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/gs008.png" width="277" height="400" alt="Tipping his hat" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now this gentleman
happened to
be Uncle Jack, the
uncle and guardian
of the Five Mice,
whose father and
mother were dead;
and then it was,
when he came to
live in it with his
five nephews and
nieces, and Mrs.
Posset the nurse,
and Susan the
cook, and Thomas
the gardener, then it was, I say, that the old Junk-shop, as the
villagers called it was turned into the most delightful house in
the world, which I call my MOUSE-TRAP.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE MICE.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/gs010.png" width="300" height="215" alt="Lilies of the valley" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nibble</span>, Brighteyes, Fluff, Puff, and Downy the baby. There are
the names of the mice, all written out nicely for you, and there in a
corner is a glimpse of the mouse-trap. Of course the children have
real names, just like other children; but I have given them mouse-names,
which I very much prefer to Harry and Bessie, and&mdash;but oh!
dear, I didn't mean to tell you any of their real names. Nibble is the
oldest. He is now a fine bright boy-mouse of twelve, but when he first
came to the mouse-trap he was only eight years old, and Brighteyes,
the oldest girl-mouse, was seven. Then came Fluff and Puff, the twins,
who were just five, and Downy the baby, a fat little fellow of three.
You see their ages were
quite near enough for
them all to be great
friends and playmates,
and so they were. I
never shall forget the
day they came. It was
a fine bright day in May,
and Spring was just
awake in the old garden. The short new grass was like emerald;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the old gnarled apple-trees, which certainly did look like Jonas Junk
when their branches were bare, had lost all trace of such likeness, for
each was crowned with a pink and white snowdrift of blossoms.
Down in the neglected flower-beds the crocuses and snowdrops
were nodding and whispering to each other. "Yes," they said, "some
new people are coming to live in the old house, and there are children
among them. Mr. Breeze, the postman, knows all about them, but he
could not stop to tell us much this morning, for he was in a hurry.
Now we shall be cared for, and watered, and there will be some
pleasure in blossoming. When the children come, we will tell them
how those vulgar
weeds pushed and
crowded us last
year." And they
did tell the children,
but children
do not understand
flower-talk, I find.
And yet it is a very
simple language.
You see, I hear
a great deal of
flower-gossip, for
my moonbeams
are sad chatterboxes, and they bring me back all sorts of news when
they come home in the morning. How the burglar-bees robbed old
Madam Peony, how the daffodils in the long border had been flirting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with the regiment of purple flags behind them, when the Tulip family
are expected; yes, there is no end to the things I hear. But if I told
all I know, everybody would be as wise as I am, so let us go on
about the mice.</p>

<p>Well, at about three o'clock in the afternoon of this fine day that I
have been describing, a large carriage, drawn by two fine black horses,
drove through the old gateway and down the quiet, lovely lane, and
stopped in front of the house. The very instant the wheels ceased
to turn, the door of the carriage burst open with a crash, and out
jumped, rolled, and tumbled my five mice. First came Nibble, in
jacket and trousers and cap. One jump out of the carriage, another
to the top of a post, and there he was. Next came Brighteyes, all
flying, feet and curls and hat and ribbons. Then one of the twins
rolled out, and the other tumbled out; and one was hurt, and the
other was not. That is always the way with those two children.
One is lucky, and one unlucky. Puff always falls on her feet. Fluff
always falls on her head. Uncle Jack often calls them Hap and
Hazard, and that is the only difference between them. However,
when they got up and shook themselves, I saw that they were very
pretty little girls. Now I will make you a picture of them. Yes, I
can draw pictures too; in fact, there are very few things that I cannot
do if I try. Here they are, Puff and Fluff, two of the dearest mice in
the world.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>Next a gentleman stepped out of the carriage; a very, very tall
gentleman, with very broad shoulders, and very bright eyes. That
was Uncle Jack; and he helped Mrs. Posset to get out, for she had
Downy asleep in her arms, and he was a pretty good armful. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Uncle Jack took some bags and bundles out of the carriage; then he
turned round and said "Now, children, we will"&mdash;There he stopped,
for not a child was to be seen, except little fat Downy, fast asleep.
Uncle Jack stared about him. Posts, trees, house, but no children.
"Sure they're all gone, surr," said John the coachman. "'Twould
be as aisy to ketch the wind and kape it still as thim childher." And
John never said a truer word in his life. If my mirror were not so
big, even I could not have seen them all. Nibble was up in a tree,
of course, picking apple-blossoms, for which he ought to have been
whipped. Indeed, the old tree did its best, for it caught him by the
leg, and tore a hole in his new trousers, which was shocking to think
of. Then he found an old bird's nest; and on the whole, the tree
seemed so very "jolly" that he decided to stay there; so that was
why Uncle Jack did not see <i>him</i> when he looked round. Brighteyes,
after seeing her
brother safely up
in the tree, flew
off like a bird, here
and there and
everywhere. First
she filled both
hands with dandelions.
Then she
saw a butterfly;
down went the
dandelions; off
went her best hat to serve as a butterfly-net; and away she went. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pretty chase Master Butterfly led her, through last year's brambles
and this year's mud, until at last he left her high and dry on the top
of a fence, and flew off so fast that he was soon out of sight. There
I left her too, for I wanted to see what the twin mice were about.</p>

<span class="caption">NIBBLE IN THE APPLE TREE.</span>
</div>

<p>I looked this way and that, but they were nowhere to be seen. At
length I caught a glimpse of something blue, among some very thick
bushes. I looked closer, and saw a sight that was truly melancholy.
Among these bushes stood a huge old wooden trough, which old
Jonas had built to receive the water that bubbled out of a spring close
by. So the trough was full of water, and this being the case, of
course Fluff the unlucky had fallen into it. How she had done it I
do not know, but there she was, splashing about in fine style.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Fluffy, and I'll pull you out!" said Puff.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, you can't!" cried poor little Fluff. "You're not any
bigger as I am, Puffy, and I'm so wet I feel very heavy."</p>

<p>And no wonder she did, for she had on a long thick coat which
was completely soaked. But Puffy was very sure about it. She gave
a great pull, and Fluff made a scramble, and out she came, knocking
Puff down and tumbling on top of her. Well, they were both wet
enough when they got up. Just then a very loud and strange noise
was heard. At least, it was strange to me, but the children cried
"Oh! the rattle, the rattle!" and away they scampered towards the
house, as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>Poor Uncle Jack! he had been working hard all the afternoon,
with John and Thomas, (who had come in a cart with the other
servants and the trunks and the dogs), clearing away rubbish and
unpacking furniture, while Mrs. Posset and the maids were busy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the house. He had been rather glad to have the children out of
the way for a little while, but now that it was six o'clock, and tea was
laid in the dining-room, and a bright wood fire blazing in the great
open fireplace, he began to wonder where his chickens were.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" he said. "Where is the rattle?" and opening a bag,
he took out a huge watchman's rattle, and sprung it briskly, making
the strange loud noise that Puff and Fluff had heard down by the
spring. Presently he heard a voice, then another, and then another.
"Here I am, Uncle!" "What is the matter, Uncle Jack?" "Hi!
supper! come on, Brighteyes!" and up scampered from all directions,
the four mice in about as pretty a plight as mice can well be
in. Brighteyes was panting for breath and limping, one shoe gone,
no hat, and any number of scratches. Puff and Fluff were wet, and
muddy, and forlorn beyond description; while with Nibble the only
question was, which was bigger, his knickerbockers or the hole in
them.</p>

<p>Uncle Jack held up his hands in amazement, and then sat down
on a packing-box and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.
"Oh! you children, you children!" he cried. "This is what comes
of bringing you to the country to keep you out of mischief. Go in
to Mrs. Posset at once, give her my compliments, and tell her I wish
her joy of you. And as soon as you are fit to be seen, come down
to supper, or Downy and I will eat it all up."</p>

<p>Away went the mice into the house and upstairs, where Mrs. Posset
scolded, and brushed, and washed, and wiped and mended to an
alarming extent. The trunk in which Nibble's clothes were packed
had not yet arrived, so the young gentleman had to wait after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
others were gone down to tea, while Mary, the housemaid, mended
his trousers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 429px;">
<img src="images/gs015.png" width="429" height="490" alt="Mending" title="" />
</div>

<p>Bread and butter and raspberry jam are always good, but they
must have seemed particularly good that evening to those five hungry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mice. Little Downy soon finished his bowl of bread and milk,
and was just thinking about some jam when Mrs. Posset appeared
in the doorway. I have a great respect for Mrs. Posset. She is
very faithful, and as fond of the mice as if they were her own
children; but I do wish she would not wear green and yellow
ribbons in her cap. It makes her look so like a stout elderly daffodil,
but that is neither here nor there. She appeared in the doorway
and looked at Downy. Downy looked at her, but did not move.
Then Mrs. Posset said, "Downy come with his Possy, and put on
his ittle nightcoatie, and go to his 'ittle beddy-house?" (That's
another thing, she always talks to that mouse as if he and she
were both idiots). "No!" said Downy. "Not want any beddy-house.
Possy go away!" "Come, Downy," said his uncle. "You
have had a long day, little man, and bed is the best place for you.
Nice bed! I wish I were in mine." "Not nice!" cried Downy.
"Naughty bed! take it away! A-a-a-ah!" and the poor little boy,
who was really tired out, began to scream and cry lustily. "Hush!"
cried Uncle Jack hastily. "Hush, Downy! the bed will hear you,
and then who knows what may happen?" Downy paused a moment
and looked at his uncle in astonishment. "What <i>do</i> you mean,
Uncle Jack?" asked Brighteyes. "Beds cannot hear."</p>

<p>"Perhaps their posts are their ears," said Fluff.</p>

<p>"Oh! Fluffy," said Puff, "you <i>know</i> their posts are their legs,
so they can't be their ears."</p>

<p>But Uncle Jack looked very grave, and said, "Have you never
heard the story of Little Willy and his bed? listen then, and I will
tell it to you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">

</div>


<p>"One night, little Willy thought he did not want to go to bed.
In fact, he felt very sure about the matter. He had had his supper
and it was half past six o'clock. There was his bed, standing firmly
on its four fluted yellow legs, the white sheet turned down, and the
pillow plumped up, looking as inviting as a bed possibly could; but
into it little Willy would not
go. First he kicked, and then
he screamed, and then he did
both together. 'I <i>won't</i> go to
bed!' he cried. 'I hate my
bed! it's cold, and horrid, and
ugly. I will <i>never</i> get into it!
naughty bed!'</p>


<p>"He was lying on the floor,
kicking the bed as hard as he
could, when suddenly what do
you think happened? I shall
shock you very much, but it
is best that you should know.
The bed began to move! slowly it lifted its fluted yellow legs,
slowly it marched across the room until it reached the window,
and then, if you will believe me, it coolly marched <i>out</i> of the window,
and thump! thump! thump! off it went down the street.</p>

<p>"Little Willy ran to the window, and looked out, with eyes and
mouth wide open, in great surprise. Yes, it was really true. The
bed was gone; there it went, tramping down the middle of the street.
Its pillow had fallen a little to one side, which gave it a jaunty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
rakish air. 'Humph!' said Willy. 'Well, I'm glad the ugly old
thing is gone. Now I shall not have to go to bed at all.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/gs018.png" width="281" height="400" alt="Tired" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That was all very well for an hour or so, but after that the
little boy began
to grow very
sleepy in spite
of himself. He
rubbed his eyes,
he yawned, he
tried to shake
himself broad
awake, but it
was of no use.
For some time
longer he fought
against the
sleepiness, but
at last he went
to his mother,
looking very
much ashamed,
and said:</p>

<p>"'Please, mamma,
I want to go
to bed!' 'I am very sorry, Willy,' said his mother; 'but you have
no bed to go to. You have driven away your good bed by
ill-treatment, and now you must sit up all night.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little Willy! he tried to go to sleep in a chair, but his
head kept tumbling backward or forward and waking him.
Oh! he was wretchedly uncomfortable, and finally he burst into
tears. 'Oh! my dear bed!' cried he. 'My nice, soft, warm,
pretty bed! why did I ever treat you so badly? oh! dear good bed,
if you will only come back to me, I will never, <i>never</i> call you
names again. Oh! oh! oh! how tired I am, and cold, and&mdash;' but
suddenly he stopped crying, for he thought he heard a noise outside.
He listened. Yes, through the open window came a faint
sound&mdash;thump! thump! thump! Willy flew to the window. Oh
joy! there was the bed, stumping back up the street on its fluted
yellow legs. Back it came, in at the window and across the room,
till it stood in its accustomed place. In about three minutes Willy's
head was on the pillow, and I believe he has never called his
bed names since."</p>

<p>"Why! bless me!" said Uncle Jack, looking down. "Here is
Downy asleep too. Let us go upstairs and see if his bed is there all
right. I hope it did not hear what he said about it, for you see they
are sensitive fellows, these beds. Now then, up we go! I will carry
Downy, Mrs. Posset, and do you bring Puff and Fluff with you, for it
is high time that they were in bed too."</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Jack is a very wise man in most things, but I should
have thought he would have known better than to try the cat-stairs
for the first time at night, with a candle in one hand, and
a child in his arms. At the first step he bumped his own head; at
the second he bumped the child's head; at the third he bumped the
candle, and put it out, so there he was in the dark. A sad plight he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
would have been in if it had not been for my beams; but two or
three of the boldest and most skilful of them popped down through
the skylight and showed him the way up: for which, by the way,
he might have thanked them, but I dare say he did not think of
it. After stumbling over a trunk, and a chair, and nearly breaking
his nose against the edge of a door, poor Uncle Jack finally
reached the large room which he had chosen to be the nursery.
Puff and Fluff, who had tumbled up behind him, looked eagerly
to see if Downy's bed was there. Yes, there it stood, drawing
its white curtains primly round it, and looking very amiable. Fluff
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I was <i>so</i> afraid it had heard what Downy
said."</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, it is a little deaf," said Puff. "It never seems
to mind, and yet he calls it all sorts of names sometimes."</p>

<p>"Can a thing be deaf in its legs, Uncle Jack?" asked
Fluff.</p>

<p>But Uncle Jack began to laugh, and that hurt Fluff's feelings, so
she said nothing more. And now Mrs. Posset came, and the three
dear little mice were soon snugly tucked up in bed; the twins
together, with their arms round each other's necks, and little Downy
curled up alone in his pretty white nest, the sweetest mouse that
ever was seen.</p>

<span class="caption">DOWNY ASLEEP IN HIS BED.</span>
</div>

<div class='center'> <table class="star" summary="star">
<tr><td align='left'>

<div class='blockquot4'><p>Ah! now it was my turn. As soon as Mrs. Posset had left the
room, down I came post-haste, on Flash, my swiftest beam. I sat
down on Fluff's pillow, and soon introduced myself to the little mice.
They were fast asleep, of course, but that is the best time to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
children. In fact, I never can get on with them when they are
awake, their heads are full of so many things. "Yes," I said, "I
really am the Man in the
Moon. I live in a silver
palace&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>


<div class='blockquot5'><p>"<i>Really</i> silver?" asked
Puff.</p>

<p>"Yes, really silver,
from top to bottom, from roof to cellar,
walls and floors, tables and chairs, dishes
and spoons are all silver, as bright as Flash,
who is dancing about the room here."</p>

<p>"I should think a silver bed would be
rather hard," said Fluff.</p>

<p>"Not when it has a cloud mattress and
pillow," I replied. "That makes it soft
enough, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Then I told them how the clouds were
divided into three classes, and how one
kind was good to sleep on, and another
good to ride on, and the third good (<i>very</i>
good, too,) to eat.</p></div>
</td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>"Does it taste like the white part in floating island?" asked
Fluff.</p>

<p>"Rather like it, but a great, great deal nicer, more like whipped
cream."</p>

<p>"And is that all you have to eat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! I have ice cream whenever I want it. All the
mountains up here are covered with ice cream instead of snow,
and I have only to send a beam out a few steps and I have all I
want; pink or white, or any color I choose."</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely!" sighed Fluff. "Tell us more, Mr. Moonman!"</p>

<p>So I told them about my neighbors, the stars, and my elder brother
in the Sun, with his splendid palace of gold and diamond. We are
very fond of each other, but we cannot often visit each other, so
we send letters and messages by the comets, who come and go, or
by the merry meteors.</p>

<p>Well, well, how many questions they did ask, those mice. I had
been telling them about my big mirror, and "Oh!" cried Puff,
"can you really see all the people in the world?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but not all at once. As I tip my glass this way or
that, so I see this place or that place. Yesterday I saw a fine sight,
I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh! what was it? what was it?" cried the three mice.</p>

<p>"You shall hear," I said, "if you will be quiet. Listen now, for
it is nearly time for me to go home, and Flash is looking pale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs021.png" width="400" height="271" alt="Anxiously looking about" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, I saw some wolves go to a concert, and that is more than
any of you ever saw, I'll warrant. In a certain wild part of northern
Germany, there lived three good brothers whom I know very well.
Their names are Hans, Karl, and Wilhelm; and they are musicians
by trade; that is to say, Hans plays on the violoncello, which is a
very big fiddle, about half as big as himself, while Wilhelm has a
small fiddle, and Karl toots away on a kind of little brass trumpet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
called a cornet. So, now you know about the men as if you had
seen them, for they do nothing in the world but play on their several
instruments. Now, yesterday there was to be a wedding, and the
three brothers were asked to come and play for the guests to dance.
Their way led through a wild and gloomy forest, where many wild
beasts roamed about; but the three started merrily, and strolled
along singing and talking together. Suddenly they stopped singing,
for they heard a noise that was not so pleasant as their song; it was
a long, low howl, and soon came another, and another. Then they
knew that the wolves were coming, and their hearts sank within
them. Anxiously they looked about them. They were in an open
space in the wood. Now a rustling was heard, and out came a
gray wolf and looked at them. The teeth of the three brothers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
chattered in their heads; it was like the sound of castanets, as I
hear them played in Spain by the black-eyed dancing-girls. Another
wolf came out, and he came yet nearer, and then two more. 'If I
had but my gun!' cried Hans. 'If I had but my hunting-knife!'
said Karl. 'Ah! brothers,' said Wilhelm, 'we have nothing, so
we must die. Nevertheless, let us die merrily, so take your instruments
and we will play a tune for these beasts, that we may all
dance together.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs022.png" width="400" height="279" alt="The wolves" title="" />
</div>

<p>"So the three brothers took their instruments, the big fiddle, and
the little fiddle, and the trumpet, and began to play. As the first
notes sounded the wolves stopped short. Seeing this, the brothers
played the faster a merry waltz, which they had meant to play at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the wedding. 'Tra-la-la! tra-la-la!' gaily rang out the notes in
the clear air, while the musicians' teeth rattled like the castanets,
and their limbs trembled, and their hands could scarcely hold the
instruments; for they were playing for their lives, you see! yes,
and they won the game, for the wolves, who were not used to
concerts, did not know what to make of this sort of thing. They
began to be frightened, to wonder what strange beasts these were,
with such wild voices. They looked at each other and drew back a
step or two, it was well to be near the forest in any case. Further
and further they retired toward the shade of the trees, and finally,
as the music changed to a furious jig, and the trumpet sounded
out like the scream of a panther, the terrified wolves turned tail
and ran as fast as their fright and their four legs could carry them.
Off as fast in the opposite direction ran also Hans, Karl, and
Wilhelm, playing as they went. They played and ran, ran and
played till they reached the open fields and the houses; and then
they sat down under a haystack and did not move for the rest of
the day. Ah! that was a fine concert! but there was no music
at the wedding, which is sad to think of."</p>

<p>With that I kissed my three mice, and bade them good-night,
though it was nearly morning; then mounting my moonbeam
I whisked away, and soon left mice and mouse-trap far behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>JOLLYKALOO.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> is not that a pretty song? and so simple, I should think a
baby might understand it. And yet Downy did not seem to
understand a word of it, though the birds that sang it were just
outside his window in the great linden-tree.</p>

<p>He only said, "Oh! so pitty bird finging!" (he cannot say S, so
he says F instead, which sounds very funny). And then he rolled
out of bed; and then Fluff and Puff rolled out of bed. Puff ran to
the window and put back the curtains. The birds were still singing,
and the soft May breeze was blowing, and a perfect gust of song
and sweetness came in at the little old window as she pushed it
open.</p>

<p>"Oh! lovely, lovely!" cried Puff. "And look, Fluffy, from this
other window. What a fine play-ground! Oh! Possy, do give us
tubby-rubby quickly, and let us get out of the window!"</p>

<p>"Out of the window!" cried Mrs. Posset; "The child is mad!"
but then she came and looked for herself.</p>

<p>Yes, it was indeed a fine place. One part of the house was lower
than the rest, and this lower part had a flat roof, covered with gravel,
and with an iron railing round it. Two of the nursery windows
opened directly on this sunny flat place, so that it really was a most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
delightful spot. In a very few minutes there were three mice
tumbling about on the gravel, and then presently there were two
more, for other windows opened on the flat roof also, and Nibble
and Brighteyes were not the mice to be behindhand when any fun
was going on. Ah! that was the way to get an appetite for
breakfast. Jump, dance, run, tumble, till the rattle sounded from
below; then whirr! downstairs all like a flock of pigeons. They
never lost any time in getting from one place to another, these mice.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack," said Nibble, "What shall we call this place?"</p>

<p>"This dear, delightful place!" cried Brighteyes.</p>

<p>"Dis dear, 'lightful plafe!" murmured Downy, with his mouth
full of bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Jack, "now let us see. It certainly ought to
have a name."</p>

<p>"Oh! of course!" said all the mice very decidedly.</p>

<p>"Suppose we call it the Garden House," said Uncle Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Nibble. "That isn't jolly enough, Uncle Jacket!
it's such a <i>jolly</i> place, you know. I want to call it Jollykaloo!"</p>

<p>And then in a chorus rose the five voices, "Jollykaloo! Jollykaloo!"
so Jollykaloo it was named then and there, and it has
been called so ever since.</p>

<p>"And now, children," said Uncle Jack, when breakfast was over,
"We must go and see how our four-footed friends have passed
the night. You may find some new friends too, I think, with two
feet. Come Nibble, Brighteyes, Puff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack," said Puff, very gravely; "Fluff and I have not
unpacked the dolls yet, and I think it is both of our duty to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
care of our children first, before we see the animals. Don't you
think so, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"Both of your duty, eh?" said Uncle Jack, laughing. "Well,
Puffsy, perhaps it is. It is also both of your duty to learn grammar,
but you need not begin just yet. Off with you!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/gs024.png" width="304" height="300" alt="opening a case" title="" />
</div>

<p>So the twins went one way, and Uncle Jack went the other.
Which way shall I take you first, all you other children? shall we
follow the twins first, and take a peep at the dolls? by all means!
I cannot say that I care much for dolls myself, but I always like
to see what interests children, and certainly Puff and Fluff did
take great interest in their china and wax babies. By and by
I shall have some funny stories to tell you about these dolls, for
they have seen more of life than any dolls that I have ever known,
but we will not stop now, for we all want to go and see the animals, I
am sure. We will just take a peep at them and see what they are like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>See, here they are, six of them. The one sitting in the chair, with
curls and flowers, is Vashti Ann. She was the head doll at that time,
and a person of great importance. Next to her is Tina, her daughter,
a fine baby rather larger than her mother; and then comes Rosalie,
a Swiss doll, with fine long hair. The doll in the lower left-hand
corner is the unfortunate Sally Bradford, the maid-of-all-work; next
comes Fanny Ellsler, the dancer, and the last is Katinka, a Polish
lady of high rank.</p>

<p>The dear little twin mice unpacked all these creatures with the
utmost care.</p>

<p>"I think they are all ill after the journey, Puff!" said Fluffy, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>"We was better put them all to bed. Tina is very pale, and
Rosalie is very red."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then one has a chill, and the other has a fever," said Puff.</p>

<p>"Yes, they must go to bed; and I will get the bed ready, Fluffy,
if you will read them a story to amoose them."</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Puffy, if you put them both in the same bed it will
be chills-and-fever, and then we shall catch it and be ill ourselves!"
exclaimed Fluff with a distressed look.</p>

<p>"Fluff," said Miss Puff severely; "You are sometimes a foolish
child!"</p>

<p>Well, Fluff knew that she was foolish, because she was often told
so, and she was a child who always believed what was said to
her, so she meekly sat down and read a story to the dolls. It
was one of "Aunt Bathsheba's" stories, and they are so funny
that I always write them down when I hear them. Listen to
this, now!</p>

<p>There were fine doings in the garden all this time, as I found
when I turned my eyes in that direction. Three mice and an
uncle, (it would not be polite to call Uncle Jack a rat, and yet
if a mouse's uncle is not a rat, what is he, I should like to know?)
and John and Thomas, and three dogs and two horses and a
donkey, there were enough to make things lively, you will confess.</p>

<p>The dogs interested me particularly, as I have a dog of my own,
you know. Ah! he is a good fellow, that dog of mine! His name
is Bmfkmgth, and none of you will be able to pronounce that,
except the children who live in Wales. It is rather a hard name,
but he came from the Dog Star, and the language there is somewhat
difficult. Say it to your dogs, however, and see if they do not wag
their tails. Yes, they understand each other. Bmfkmgth is green,
a color that I never see in dogs on your planet; but that may be
because he eats so freely of the green cheese which grows here
instead of grass.</p>

<p>Well, there were three dogs at Jollykaloo, as perhaps I said
before. There was Gruff the big dog, and Grim the middle-sized
dog, and Grab, the little dog.</p>

<p>Gruff was a fine fellow, indeed; a great St. Bernard, clever and
good-natured, and certainly with nothing gruff about him except his
name and his bark. Indeed, it was well that he was of a cheerful
turn of mind, for he had to take a good deal of rough usage, though
it was only in play, to be sure.</p>

<p>Fancy trying to drive three dogs tandem, all of different sizes
and dispositions! Yes, if you will believe me, that was what Nibble
was trying to do when I looked down into the garden that morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
He had a very nice little cart which Thomas, the gardener, had made
for him, and in this he often drove Gruff, who did not object at
all to being harnessed, and in fact rather enjoyed dragging the
children about. But when it came to having two other dogs harnessed
in front of him, dogs who could run about twice as fast as
he could, and who took a fancy to sit down and scratch their ears
just as he had started into a good swinging trot&mdash;that was rather
more than Gruff could endure. But Nibble was full of his new sport.</p>

<p>"Downy, baby!" he cried, "Come, Downy, and brother will
give you a fine ride! come along, little man!"</p>

<p>So Downy came toddling up, and Nibble lifted him into the
cart, and then got in himself, and took the reins and the whip.</p>

<p>"Now, Downy boy, you shall have the best ride that any one
ever had. Hi! my gallant steeds! Now Dasher, now Dancer,
now Prancer! Oh, dear!" cried Nibble, "I wish I had eight
reindeer like St. Nicholas, instead of only three dogs. But still
I can say, 'Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!'" and the
young charioteer stood up in the cart and waved the whip round
his head, while Downy clapped his hands and shouted with glee.
Yes, that was pride! but the fall also was not wanting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/gs028.png" width="373" height="500" alt="OLD GRUFF." title="" />
<span class="caption">OLD GRUFF.</span>
</div>

<p>Away went the three dogs, poor old Gruff forced into a lumbering
gallop by the pace of the two others, who capered along, and let
the big old dog do all the pulling. Round the house they went
once and twice, the little cart rocking from side to side in rather an
alarming way. Then, as they came round the third time&mdash;they saw a
cat! Nibble saw it first, and tried like a clever mouse as he is, to turn
his gallant steeds' heads away before they also saw it: but it was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
late. "Yap! yap! yap!" went little Grab; "Woof! woof!" added
Grim, struggling to free himself from the harness. Good old Gruff
held out bravely for a moment or two; but finally he could not resist.</p>

<p>A mighty "<i>Bow</i>, wow WOW!" a leap and
a plunge, and then for a moment I could see
nothing but a cloud of dust, from which came barks
and shrieks which were truly dreadful to hear. In a
moment, however, the cart luckily was caught between
two bushes, and there it stuck, while the dogs rushed
to the foot of the nearest apple-tree, to leap and
howl there in vain excitement, while the peaceful cat
smiled at them in safety from the topmost bough.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 148px;">
<img src="images/gs029.png" width="148" height="300" alt="Cat climbing a tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the moment the explosion took place, two
people came upon the scene, one from the barn
and one from the house. They were Uncle Jack
and Mrs. Posset. The latter had happened to look
out of the window just as the grand turn-out
came round for the third time, and she had flown down stairs to
rescue her Downy, but arrived only in time to snatch him from
the ruins of the cart, very much frightened and covered with
dust, and what was worse with blood, which flowed from a cut
in his forehead. As for Uncle Jack, he had been very busy in
the barn arranging matters with John and had supposed that
Downy was quite safe with Nibble and Gruff to look after him.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," cried Mrs. Posset in an angry tone, "what is
to be done with Nibble? this blessed child's life is not safe with him
for an instant, so it isn't! putting three dogs tantrum (Mrs. Posset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
meant tandem, but she was too much vexed to think about her
words,) with an innocent baby behind them and the garden as full
of cats as his head is of mischief!" and the good woman's breath
fairly failed her, from haste and vexation combined. Uncle Jack
looked very grave as he came up.</p>

<p>"How did this happen, Nibble?" he asked. "Mrs. Posset, if you
will take Downy into the house and bathe his forehead, I will come
in and find some court-plaster to put on that cut. Now my boy,"
he added, turning to Nibble, "tell me all about this!"</p>

<p>Nibble hung his head and looked very much ashamed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did have them tandem," he said. "I never thought of
cats, and Downy likes to ride so much!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Nibble!" said Uncle Jack, "I certainly thought
I could trust you to take care of your little brother for ten minutes.
There are plenty of ways of amusing a little child without putting
him in danger of his life; for Downy might have been very much
hurt, perhaps even killed, and then you would never have forgiven
yourself. Remember, my boy, that there is a great difference
between three years and eight years, and that what may be harmless
for you may be very dangerous for your little brother."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Uncle, I am very sorry!" said Nibble earnestly; "and I
will try to be more careful. And&mdash;and what shall I do now,
Uncle? there isn't any punishment tree here, is there?"</p>

<p>This question puzzled me at the time, but I found out afterwards
that in the place where they had lived before, there was one special
tree into which Nibble always had to climb when he had been
naughty, and where he had spent many hours of penance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Jack smiled kindly on the boy&mdash;I mean the mouse&mdash;and
said "I have not found one yet, dear child! but I think that
if you were to spend the rest of the morning in the house, and try to
console Downy for his bumps and bruises, it would be a very
good thing."</p>

<p>Nibble looked grave at this. He would have preferred sitting in a
tree, and hearing the birds sing, and wondering where their nests
might be, and how many eggs there might be in them, to spending
the lovely, sunny morning in the house. But he went in without
a word, remembering that Downy also had to stay in the house
through his carelessness, and with aches and pains which he somehow
had escaped.</p>

<p>He found the baby mouse curled up on the sofa in the library,
looking very forlorn, with a handkerchief tied round his head. Mrs.
Posset was sitting beside him, reading to him, for though Downy
was a very little boy, he was very fond of stories. His eyes
brightened when he saw Nibble. "Oh! Nibby!" he cried.
"Did dey catf de cat?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I hope not!" said Mrs. Posset. "It is a strange thing
in the nature of boys, that they like to see cats tormented."</p>

<p>"But I don't like to see them hurt, Mrs. Posset!" said Nibble.
"It <i>is</i> fun to see them run, but the dogs never catch them, so
no harm is done. And it is good for the cats to have a little
exercise, I am sure, for they are lazy creatures."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mrs. Posset. "Well, I am reading to Downy
now, Master Nibble, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like me to take the book, Mrs. Posset?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Nibble. "I must stay in the house till dinner, and I could read
to Downy."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, Nibby, read!" cried Downy.</p>

<p>"Very well, Master Nibble, and that is just what will please
me, for I have not my spectacles by me, and the print troubles
my eyes. Besides, the child's clothes are torn to shrivers, (this was a
pet word of Mrs. Posset's, and I think she must have invented it
herself,) and I must attend to them at once."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Posset, with an approving nod, trotted off to the nursery,
and Nibble sat down by the sofa.</p>

<p>"What shall I read, Downy boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Wead Pinfkin!" said Downy very decidedly.</p>

<p>"'Princekin,' eh?" said Nibble, "Well, here it is, so listen!
And perhaps, if you were to shut your eyes, Downy, you might
see some of the pretty things that Princekin saw."</p>

<p>So Nibble opened the book, from which Mrs. Posset had been
reading, and read this little rhyme:</p>

</div>

<p>Then Nibble stopped reading, and closed the book softly, for
Downy was just as fast asleep as Princekin had been.</p>

<p>"That is always the way!" he said to himself. "I never saw a
child sleep so much in the daytime. In fact, there is no use in
reading to him, unless you want him to go to sleep. But perhaps,"
he added "that is just what Mrs. Posset did want, and it is the best
thing to do when one cannot go out of doors. Heigh ho! how
pleasant it is out there! I wonder where Brighteyes is! She might
come in and stay with me, I think, if she knows I am in the house."
And Nibble sat down by the window, and looked mournfully out
into the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs031.png" width="400" height="267" alt="Looking out the window" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>I also had been wondering where Brighteyes was, for I had
not seen her since breakfast. I was just going to look in another
part of the mirror, (for I can see the whole of the garden in it,
and more too,) when I heard a deep sigh at my elbow. I turned, and
saw my dog standing by, gazing into the mirror with a very wistful
look. I followed the direction of his eyes, and saw that the cat was
still up in the tree, and the dogs still at the foot of it. Gruff was tired
of jumping, which indeed was not exactly in his line; and had
gone quietly to sleep; but Grim and Grab kept up the game,
occasionally lying down to rest and take breath, and then going at it
again.</p>

<p>"What ails thee, Bmfkmgth?" I asked. "Doth the sight of the
other dogs grieve thee?"</p>

<p>"Nay, master!" he answered. "But oh! I fain would have a cat
to chase. Is there no Cat-Star, good master, whence thou couldst
get me a cat? see now, how merry these dogs have been!"</p>

<p>"Truly," I replied, "there is no Cat-Star; and if there were, thou
wouldst be none the better off, for I would not have such noise
and strife in my quiet home. Art thou not happy? here thou hast no
work to do; canst eat green cheese all day, if it please thee, and sport
with the merry beams which my brother Sun sends over. Perhaps
thou wouldst like to go back to the Dog Star, whence thou
camest. There thou hadst work enough and to spare, for thou
wast servant to Prince Canis, and he is a hard master." And I
tipped the mirror, so that we could see Sirius (which is the name of
that star,) and what was going on in it. There sat Prince Canis on
his throne, richly dressed. Hundreds of servants bowed before him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
or hurried hither and thither to do his bidding. He spoke harshly
to them, and flourished a huge whip, which was his sceptre, about
their ears, making them howl with pain.</p>

<p>"Wilt thou go back?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" cried the dog, shrinking back. "Tip the glass
away, my master, lest he see me and carry me off! I promise thee
I will never complain again!"</p>

<p>"That is well!" I said. "And if thou wantest something to chase,
thou mayest chase me, though that would not be very exciting. So
now, we will look for Brighteyes, and see what has become of the
child."</p>

<p>I tipped the glass, and again the garden blossomed before me,
sunny and bright, shining with grass-emerald and dandelion gold,
under the drifts of apple-blossoms. Yes, it was a pretty sight, and
whichever way I may tip my glass, I see no prettier sight than
this garden, in the spring of the year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>TOMTY.</h3>


<div class='blockquot6'><br /><br /><p><span class="smcap">Brighteyes</span> had been spending the
morning with Tomty of course; anyone might
have known that, for she was always with
Tomty whenever she could not be found anywhere
else. Tomty was the gardener, and his
real name was Thomas Wilson, but the mice thought
that Tomty was a much better name, and I think so
too. He was the kindest gardener that ever lived,
I think, and I have seen a good many. He liked
nothing better than to have all the five mice trotting
at his heels while he went about his work. They
might hide his shears, and run off with his trowel, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
take his rake and hoe for hobbyhorses, but Tomty was never out
of patience with them.</p></div>

<div class='blockquot3'><p>"Sure, they're young things!" he used to say. "Let them enjoy
themselves now, for they'll be older before they're younger!" Which
was a very sensible remark.</p>

<p>"Tomty!" said Brighteyes.</p></div>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p></td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>"I want to go into the barn-yard again to see Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"And that is just where I am going, miss," said Tomty; "so if
you will sit in the wheelbarrow, I'll give you a ride!" so Brighteyes
jumped into the wheelbarrow and was wheeled off in fine style.</p>

<p>"Do you know who invented the wheelbarrow, Tomty?" she
asked as they went along.</p>

<p>"Yes miss," replied Tomty. "Hiram Deluce made this one,
miss."</p>

<p>"I don't mean this one," said Brighteyes. "I mean the first one
that ever was made. It was a great painter, one of the greatest
painters that ever lived, only I can't remember his name. Uncle Jack
told me about him."</p>

<p>"Yes Miss!" said Tomty. "More likely a <i>car</i>-painter, Miss. I
don't know what a painter would want of a barrow, unless to paint it,
and that's soon done."</p>

<p>A car-painter! Brighteyes thought that was very funny, and she
thought Tomty was very clever.</p>

<p>But now they were in the barn-yard, and she straightway forgot
about wheel-barrows and painters, for Jos&eacute;, the little brown donkey,
was loose, and was trying with might and main to open the further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gate of the yard, a trick of which he was extremely fond, and in which
he certainly excelled.</p>

<p>"Oh! Tomty," cried Brighteyes, "shut the gate, and let us catch
Jos&eacute;. Naughty donkey, how did you get out? Come here, good
Jos&eacute;! come here, poor fellow!" But Jos&eacute; (that is a Spanish name,
by the way, and is pronounced Hosay,) had no idea of going there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">

<span class="caption"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">JOS&Eacute;</ins> OPENING THE GATE.</span>
</div>

<p>"I wont!" he said. "I wo-<i>hon't!</i> go away-<i>hay!</i>" and up went his
heels, higher than ever. It must be very provoking to animals to
have human beings pay absolutely no attention to their remarks.
Really, it is so stupid sometimes. There was Jos&eacute;, speaking quite
distinctly for a donkey, and Brighteyes only clapped her hands to
her ears and cried "Oh! what a dreadful bray!" and in the barn,
meanwhile, Pollux, the off horse, was saying to John, over and over
again, "I don't like this stall, John! please give me another. And
do loosen this strap a little, for it makes my head ache." To
which John replied, "So, boy! quiet now!" which must have
been extremely aggravating.</p>

<p>Why, I saw a little girl once,&mdash;a little German girl she was, named
Hannchen,&mdash;sit for half an hour listening with great delight to a bird
which was singing away with all its might, perched on a neighboring
twig. And what do you think the bird was saying in its song?</p>

<p>"You horrid little monster, why will you not go away? I want to
get some caterpillars from that tree behind you, and I cannot get
at them while you are there. My children are waiting for their
dinner, and though I have asked you fifty times, as politely as I could,
to move, you will not stir, but just sit there and look silly. Oh! you
provoking little creature! I should like to peck you!" And little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Hannchen, smiling, said "thank you, pretty bird, for your sweet
song!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/gs035.png" width="319" height="350" alt="Sitting on a log" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was quite a
piece of work to
catch Master <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>,
but John came out
to help Thomas and
finally the obstinate
little brown gentleman
was fairly cornered,
and had to
submit to the halter.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!"
said Brighteyes.
"It must seem very
hard to be tied up
all the time. I am
sure <i>I</i> should not
like to have a strap round my nose, Tomty, and stand all day with
nothing but the barn walls to look at."</p>

<p>"And indeed you would not, Miss!" replied Tomty gravely.
"But sure no one would go for to put a strap round a little lady's
nose, Miss, let alone putting her in the barn."</p>

<p>"Oh! you funny Tomty!" cried Brighteyes. "I meant, if I were
a donkey, of course!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss! but you see you are not a donkey," said Tomty
placidly. "And now I must go back to the flower-beds again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Miss Brighteyes," he added. "And will you go with me, Miss,
or shall I leave you here?"</p>

<p>"Well, Tomty, I think I will stay here for a little while and talk to
the chickabiddies. I don't think they know me yet, and I want them
to know me and love me, for Uncle Jack says I may feed them every
morning. You won't be lonely without me, will you, Tomty?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss, I'll do my best!" said Tomty.</p>

<p>With which rather vague remark the good man took up his wheelbarrow
and departed, leaving Brighteyes alone in the barn-yard.
Alone, that is, except for the fowls. They had just arrived that
morning, and they evidently did not feel at home in their new
quarters. The hens were scratching and bustling about in great
excitement, while one of the roosters, standing on top of the fence,
preached them a sermon on keeping their tempers.</p>

<p>"Be calm!" he said. "Be calm,
my dears! haste makes waste. Observe
my tranquil demeanor! the truly great
are calm in the midst of strife."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/gs036.png" width="233" height="250" alt="Rooster" title="" />
</div>

<p>And he shut one eye, and looked at
Brighteyes with the other, as much as
to say "What do you think of that?
it's nothing to what I can do if I try!"
but Brighteyes burst out laughing, and
said "Chook-a-raw-che-raw! I can say that too, Mr. Rooster, so
you need not be so proud."</p>

<p>At this the rooster was deeply offended, and withdrew to a corner
of the yard, muttering to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Brighteyes spied three fowls, two hens and an old rooster,
who apparently were too sleepy to care where they were, for they had
all gone to sleep, sitting side by side on a rail, and very funny
they looked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Brighteyes. "Don't they look just like the sixty-five
parrots asleep in a row, in the 'Four Little Children who
went round the world?' Don't you remember?" she went on,
half to herself and half to the other fowls, "the Pussy-Cat and
the Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of
all the sixty-five parrots; for which Violet reproved them both
severely. Notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the
feathers&mdash;two-hundred and sixty in number&mdash;in her bonnet;
thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance,
highly&mdash;well, I forget the rest," said she, "for the words are
very long."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/gs037.png" width="195" height="250" alt="Chicken" title="" />
</div>

<p>"How pretty some of those tail-feathers would look in my hat!"
she continued. "I shouldn't like to bite them
off, but I might pull some out, for there are
so many they would never be missed. Just
a few out of each tail, you know; and I am
sure they wouldn't mind, if they knew it was
to make my hat have a lovely and glittering
appearance. One good smart pull, now&mdash;"
and suiting the action to the word, she tugged
with might and main at the tail of the old
rooster. But the old rooster had apparently never read the
story about Violet and the sixty-five parrots; for instead of submitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
meekly to having his tail-feathers pulled out, he woke up in a
great rage and fright, and uttering a tempest of "ka-ka-kaaa-ka-raws"
he flew directly in Brighteye's face.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/gs038.png" width="323" height="325" alt="Running through the woods" title="" />
</div>

<p>Greatly terrified, Brighteyes
staggered backward,
and sat down violently
in a tub filled with hay.</p>

<p>Yes, that would have
been very well, if there
had been nothing beside
hay in it. But, unfortunately,
Uncle Jack had
bought with these fowls
some eggs of a peculiar
kind, from which he
hoped to get a very fine
brood of chickens; and he had made a fine nest for them in
this tub and left them till one of the hens should take a fancy
to them.</p>

<p>Well, that was all over now. Brighteyes heard the crash, and
knew that something dreadful must have happened. The angry
rooster was fluttering and pecking at her feet, and the poor mouse,
half-wild with fright, sprang up once more and rushed out of the
barn-yard, forgetting in her haste to shut the gate behind her. She
never stopped till she had gained the shade of the apple-trees, and
there she sat down panting on the grass.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" she cried, "I will never try to do things out of story-books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
again as long as I live. Whenever I do it, I am sure to get
into trouble. The other day Uncle Jack showed me a picture in
<i>Punch</i>, of some children putting out their tongues when they
met the doctor, and he laughed, and said it was very funny, and so it
was: so then the next time I met our doctor, I put out my
tongue, but he didn't laugh, and Mrs. Posset put red pepper on
my tongue, to teach me better manners. And now, just because
I wanted to do what Violet did, all these dreadful things have
happened. But oh!" and she sprang to her feet, "I must do
something about my dress, or Mrs. Posset will say, I am 'a sight
to behold!' She always says that, and I am so tired of hearing
it. If I were to roll on the grass, now! we always wipe our
shoes on the grass, when they are muddy, before we go into the
house."</p>

<p>Certainly, the dress was in a very forlorn condition, being covered
with egg behind, while the front of the skirt showed a number of
dismal rents made by the beak and claws of the angry rooster.
I did not think it would be improved by rolling on the grass, but
I could not well do anything about it.</p>

<p>A pretty sight Miss Brighteyes was when she got up again. Egg
and grass and mud were worked and rolled together into an even
tint of brownish green, all over her skirts, while through the holes
her scarlet petticoat looked out indignantly, blushing for its owner's
misdeeds. At least, that is what my dog said about it, and he has a
very pretty way of putting things. However, Missy Mouse was
quite satisfied that she had done all she could in the matter, so
she went on her way rejoicing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently she heard voices, and she came upon Puff and Fluff, who,
having put all their children to sleep, had come out to spend
the rest of the bright, sunny morning in the garden. They had got
out their gardening tools, and were hard at work in one of
the flower-beds.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Twinnies?" asked Brighteyes as she
came up. "And where is Tomty?"</p>

<p>"Tomty is gone to his dinner," answered Puff. "And we are
trying to do all his work for him before he comes back."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Fluff, "because he often helps us, you know, and
so we ought to help him."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs039.png" width="450" height="318" alt="In the garden" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But what are all those funny-looking things sticking up?"
Brighteyes asked, stooping over the bed.</p>

<p>"Well, sister, those are the roots of the plants," said Puff. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
heard Tomty say that what the plants needed now was sun, and so
we thought the roots ought to have some sun too. So we have
been turning them upside down to save Tomty the trouble."</p>

<p>"Save Tomty the trouble, indeed!" said Brighteyes. "Why,
you naughty little mice, you have made twice as much trouble for
him. The roots don't want any sun, they like to be in the dark,
just like owls and bats. Now you have been naughty, and Uncle
Jack will punish you."</p>

<p>Poor little twin mice! they looked very grave indeed. Fluffy's
eyes filled with tears, and she began to rub them with her little
grimy hands, which did not improve her appearance. But Puff
said bravely:</p>

<p>"They do not <i>look</i> a bit like owls, Brighteyes, or like bats either;
but if you are really sure that they ought to be in the ground, we
will put them back again."</p>

<p>"Well, here comes Tomty himself!" cried Brighteyes, "and you
will see what he says. See, Tomty!" she went on. "These
naughty twinnies have been turning the plants upside down, and
spoiling them!"</p>

<p>"But we didn't mean to spoil them, Tomty!" cried the twins
eagerly. "We thought the roots ought to have the sun, and we
only wanted to save you the trouble, Tomty dear! and we are so
sorry!"</p>

<p>Tomty rubbed his left ear, which he always did when he was
put out. At least a dozen of his best plants were ruined, but he
could not scold the little mice, whose little piteous faces were turned
up to him imploringly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well!" he said. "To be sure! isn't that a pity now! but
they're young things, they're young things! never you mind, Missies,
this time, for there are plenty more plants. But remember:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Roots and moles, where'er they're found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like to burrow in the ground.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh! yes, you good Tomty, we will remember!" cried the twins.
"And we will turn them all back again as quickly as we can."</p>

<p>"Well, Missies, you may do that," replied Tomty, "though it's
all one now to them plants if they're on their heads or their
heels. But Miss Brighteyes," he continued, turning to the elder
mouse, who was looking on with an air of superior wisdom: "it's not
my place to speak about the little ladies' clothes, Miss, but whatever
will Mrs. Posset say when she sees your frock? and the barn-yard
gate open, too, and the fowls all over the place!"</p>

<p>Brighteyes hung down her head and blushed as red as her
petticoat: then, without saying a word, she turned away, and walked
slowly toward the house.</p>

<p>Yes, she had been very naughty, much naughtier than the twins,
whom she had been blaming; and now she would go directly in
to Mrs. Posset and tell her all about it, and say she was very
sorry.</p>

<p>That was what she thought as she walked along, and that was
what she meant to do, doubtless; but dear me! sometimes I
think that you people on the earth <i>never</i> do what you mean to do. I
know a gentleman in London, if you will believe it, who has
been trying for five years to see the sun rise. Every night when
he goes to bed he says, "Aha! to-morrow morning I shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
up bright and early, sir! Want to see the sun rise. Haven't seen it
since I was a boy. Ha! ha! ha!" and then he goes to bed,
and knows nothing till nine o'clock the next morning, when the sunbeams
flirt gold-dust into his eyes and wake
him up. Then he rubs his eyes, and says
"Bless me! overslept myself again, hey? well,
I never <i>was</i> so sleepy before in my life! the
sun will have to see <i>me</i> rise this morning, hey?
ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/gs040.png" width="200" height="195" alt="Sunrise queen" title="" />
</div>

<p>Yes, that is the way with you all, and that was the way with
Brighteyes that day. I did but turn away from the mirror for
five minutes, to chat with a passing meteor, and ask him how his
grandmother was; and when I turned back, where was that bright-eyed
mouse but up at the very top of a tree: trying with all her might
to catch a small cat, the very same cat which the dogs had been
chasing an hour before.</p>

<p>"Dear little Pusscat!" cried Brighteyes in her most winning tones.
"I wouldn't hurt you for the world. Do come, and let me take you
down, and you shall be my own dear little pet, and I will love
you very much indeed!" and she stretched out one arm toward the
kitten, while the other clasped a branch of the tree.</p>

<p>The kitten looked hard at her, and on the whole seemed to approve
of her, for it advanced slowly, and finally allowed itself to be captured.
Yes, that was very nice; but how about getting down?</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/gs041.png" width="254" height="300" alt="Holding a kitten" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh! that is easily managed!" said Brighteyes, thinking aloud as
usual. "I'll hold my kitty so, you see, with one hand, and with the
other I just swing myself down to that great big huge branch, <i>so</i>&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
as she started, there was a sound of something tearing, and this was
very natural, for the skirt of her unlucky frock was caught on a
small bough and refused to accompany her to the lower branch;
but it was too late for Brighteyes to
stop herself. Down she went, alighting
safely on the big branch, from which she
could easily swing herself down to the
ground. But, alas! more than half of
her skirt had remained on the upper
branch. There it hung, and flapped
about in a most unpleasant way, and
there stood Brighteyes, gazing ruefully
at the ruin she had wrought, but still
clasping the kitten tightly in her arms.</p>


<p>Now I want to ask you if you think Mrs. Posset could possibly
have chosen a worse time for looking out of the window? she did,
however, think it proper to look out just at that particular moment;
and as I saw from her face that she meant mischief, and as I have
the strongest possible objection to seeing children punished, I just
tipped my glass and saw the people of Nankin ringing the bells on
the Porcelain Tower, to celebrate the Emperor's birthday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT JOURNEY.</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/gs042.png" width="339" height="325" alt="On a flying carpet" title="" />
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span> has been a fine day!" I said, as I sat down by Brighteyes'
pillow. "Certainly it cannot be said that you five mice spend your
time in idleness. The only wonder is that your uncle's hair has
not turned gray from anxiety, long before this. I never saw such
mice. Positively, Pun-Chin is nothing to you."</p>

<p>"And who is Pun-Chin?" asked Brighteyes. "And who are
you, if you please?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pun-Chin is a Chinese mouse&mdash;I mean boy," I replied. "And
I am the Man in the Moon. I live in a silver palace&mdash;" and then
I told her all about myself, as I had told Downy and the twins the
night before. But Brighteyes was much more excited about it
all than the little ones had been. Very little children take everything
for granted I find, like my friend little Mary West, who, when
a great green frog jumped right into her lap the other day, as she
was sitting by the brook, merely said "Poor frog wanted to sit
down, was tired!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs043.png" width="450" height="281" alt="Sitting down to talk" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh!" cried Brighteyes. "How delightful! how perfectly
delightful! and are you really true, or am I only dreaming you?
and what is your name? and may I call Nibble?"</p>

<p>"One thing at a time!" I replied. "I certainly am true, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
true as moonshine. As for dreaming me, why, that depends on
what you call dreaming, you know. And as for my name&mdash;humph!
can you pronounce Bmfkmgth, for example? that is the name of my
dog, and it is a good name, too."</p>

<p>"No!" said Brighteyes. "I certainly cannot. It sounds like
sneezing and barking and whistling all at once."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" I replied. "That is the language of the dog-star.
But <i>my</i> name is very much harder than that, so there really would
be no use in my telling it to you. There are twenty-four j's in it,
and seventeen g's, so you may imagine that it is difficult. The
other children call me Mr. Moonman, and you may as well do so too.
As for Nibble," I continued, "if he sleeps in this little room close
by, it is an easy matter to call him. Whisk, just ask that boy's bed
if it will please step in here, will you?" The good beam did his errand
quickly, and in another moment the two beds stood side by side,
and shook castors in a very friendly manner. Nibble, who was as
fast asleep as heart could desire, was very much astonished as Brighteyes
introduced him to me, and told him all the wonderful things
she had heard.</p>

<p>"But how did you get down here?" he asked. "Did you come
on a falling star?"</p>

<p>"No!" I replied. "I <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alway'">always</ins> ride on my own beams, which are
much more manageable, and swifter as well. Why, I can go round
the world in two whisks of a comet's tail."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" cried Nibble. "Mr. Moonman, don't you think you
could let me ride on one some time? I can ride very well, indeed
I can! Uncle Jack lets me ride Castor sometimes, and even <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>;
never can get me off, unless he lies down and rolls! oh! <i>please</i> let
me ride on a moonbeam! it would be <i>so</i> jolly!"</p>

<p>"Jolly enough, but not quite safe enough, my young friend!"
said I. "It is very easy to ride on a moonbeam when one knows
how, but very different when one does not. There are, however,
other ways of getting about. A nice little cloud is what you want."
I looked out of the window, but not a cloud was to be seen in the sky.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said the mice. "We should <i>so</i> like to have a ride,
Mr. Moonman. Couldn't you take us on your moonbeam? we
would sit very still, and not say a word!"</p>

<p>"And you shall have a ride," I said; "but not on Whisk. Run
now to your uncle's bureau, and bring me from the top drawer two
of his largest silk handkerchiefs." Yes, that was soon done. "Now
'Whisk,'" said I, "there must be some little Winds about here with
nothing special to do. See if you cannot find some who are willing
to give these mice a ride."</p>

<p>Off went Whisk through the window, and back he came in a
moment with seven merry little Winds, all ready for a frolic.</p>

<p>They had sung all the birds and all the flowers to sleep, they
said, and had been sitting under a tree, whistling for something to
do, and now nothing would give them greater pleasure than to blow
the two little heavy ones (for I am sorry to tell you, children, that
you are all known by that name among the lively spirits of the air,)
wherever they liked to go.</p>

<p>"That is well then," said I. "And where will you go, you two
mice?"</p>

<p>"To China!" said Nibble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! yes, to China!" cried Brighteyes. "Then we can see Pun-Chin,
the naughty boy you spoke of, and you can tell us more about
him as we go along!"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! to China," said Nibble, again; and he began to dance
wildly around the room, as if nothing would stop him. At last the
two mice were ready for their long journey through the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs044.png" width="400" height="223" alt="Fairies" title="" />
</div>

<p>"China it is then!" I said. "Spread the handkerchiefs out on
the window-sill. That's right! Now sit down on them&mdash;so! now,
little Winds, blow steadily and off we go!"</p>

<p>Ah! that was a ride worth taking, you may believe. Away
through the soft May night, over the tree-tops, over the hill-tops,
the two mice, half frightened, half delighted, sitting cross-legged on
their handkerchiefs, like two little Turks, and the merry little Winds
puffing away with might and main, while Whisk and I led the way,
and lighted it too. Yes, it was a pretty sight, had there been any one
there to see it. But if you had been there yourself, you would
only have said "See those two great white owls! how fast they fly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we came to the sea. Hundreds of my beams were there
sparkling over the shining water, and playing with the little waves,
which put up their faces, each in its white nightcap, and laughed
and danced merrily. They called to the seven Winds and said:</p>

<p>"Come down and play with us!"</p>

<p>But the Winds said "No! no! we have work to do now. We
can be very steady fellows when we choose, though you might not
think it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs045.png" width="400" height="186" alt="Fairies resting" title="" />
</div>

<p>And they puffed away bravely, to the great relief of Nibble and
Brighteyes, who had been wondering what would become of them
if the merry Winds should take a fancy to play with the waves.</p>

<p>Now they began to sing, the seven Winds, and the waves answered
them as they leaped and danced. And this is the song
they sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ever singing, ever sighing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ever floating, ever flying</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Over land and sea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bringing summer's glow and gladness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bringing winter's snow and sadness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry winds are we!</span><br />
<br />
"Greeting all with soft caresses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shaking out the maiden's tresses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till she laughs with glee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whispering to the bonny flowers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fanning them through sultry hours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry winds are we!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Then the waves tossed up their nightcaps and sang:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Ever coming, ever going,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ever ebbing, ever flowing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Children of the sea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Creeping o'er the silver beaches,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Foaming o'er the rocky reaches,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry waves are we!</span><br />
<br />
"Blue and golden in the sunlight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gray and silver in the moonlight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beautiful to see.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Giving back each star its brightness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Giving back each cloud its whiteness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Merry waves are we!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"That is charming!" said Brighteyes. "Dear little Winds,
how sweetly you sing! and how strange that we have never heard you
before."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Nibble. "What is that, that shines so over yonder?
is it a sail?"</p>

<p>Yes, it was a sail, and as we came nearer we saw a stately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ship, sailing slowly along. All her crew seemed to be asleep,
except one man, who was pacing up and down the deck.</p>

<p>He looked up as we passed, and cried "Hi! albatrosses! how
queerly they are flying! wake up, shipmate, and look at those
birds!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/gs046.png" width="313" height="450" alt="Sailing ship" title="" />
</div>

<p>But before any of the sailors were awake, we were flying far away,
while the Winds and the Waves sang together:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Wake the ship!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And shake the ship!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And over the sea we will take the ship!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Filled with oranges, candy, and toys,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some for the girls and some for the boys."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh! is it really?" asked Nibble. "I wish I had some! this
flying makes one hungry."</p>

<p>But here now was the land
again. We bade farewell to the
merry Waves, and flew along
over the sleeping country. The
lights of a great city lay before
us.</p>

<p>"Let us fly lower," said Brighteyes,
"and then we can peep
into some of the windows and
see the people asleep."</p>

<p>"That is not very safe!" I replied.
"In these great cities
there are plenty of people awake
all night; and it would never
do for us to be shot at, you know."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/gs047.png" width="242" height="350" alt="Forest by the sea" title="" />
</div>

<p>Just then a puff of smoke from a tall chimney came up, and
got into the children's eyes and noses, so that they were glad
to fly higher, where the air was pure, and fresh.</p>

<p>We passed over vast and gloomy forests, where the solemn
pines bowed slightly as the seven Winds swept by; and over green
meadows, where flocks of sheep lay huddled together, fast asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
As we went further and further eastward, the darkness began to fade.</p>

<p>"In China it will be broad daylight," I said, "and Whisk and
I shall fade almost out of sight; but we shall still be with you, so you
need feel no alarm."</p>

<p>"Are we near China now?" asked Brighteyes. "And you have
not told us about Pun-Chin, Mr. Moonman!"</p>

<p>"To be sure!" I answered. "What an excellent memory this
mouse has! well, we may very likely see Pun-Chin, and then you
shall judge for yourself. The last time I saw him, he had just
painted his little brother bright green from head to foot, and was telling
him that his father would chop him up into little bits and sow him
for grass-seed. The poor little boy was very much frightened, as
you may imagine. Yes, he is a bad fellow for mischief, that boy.</p>

<p>"But now we must fly lower," I added, "for we are over
China now. Use your eyes well, my little mice, and see all that you
can see, for there is no knowing when you will be here again."</p>

<p>The mice did use their eyes well; and indeed there were
many strange things to look at. Green rice-fields, with bright streams
of water flowing through them, made the country beautiful. Pagodas
and temples, gaily painted, and gilded, glittered in the sun, and the
queer, narrow streets were filled with people dressed in strange
garments of blue, red, and yellow. They all carried large paper
umbrellas covered with gay figures.</p>

<p>In one street we saw a boy sitting on a queer sort of gate. Three
dogs were fastened to this gate by their tails, and as they leaped
about in their efforts to free themselves, the gate swung to
and fro, thus saving the boy the trouble of swinging himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a man came slowly along the street, reading a paper
attentively, and thinking of nothing else. Just as he was passing by
the gate, however, the boy made a sudden spring, and alighting
on the man's shoulders, knocked him flat in the muddy street; then
springing up again like a flash, he resumed his place on the gate, and
looked as innocent as a lamb. But the man picked himself up
slowly, and turning round, poured a torrent of angry words on
the sportive youth.</p>

<p>"Child of perdition!" he cried, "may the Red Dragon make his
next meal of thee, and use thy bones for chopsticks! my life is of no
value to me, on account of thy tormentings.
Am I never to be left in peace?"</p>

<p>The boy, smiling sweetly, was about to reply;
but at that moment a woman, who was
passing by, happened to look up, and caught
sight of the two red silk handkerchiefs in
the air, with Nibble and Brighteyes on them.
Me they could not see, nor the seven Winds,
but the children were plainly visible, and very
funny they must have looked.</p>

<p>"Hop-Wang!" cried the woman. "Look
up quickly, and see these strange things in
the sky! it is some fearful sign from the gods,
I fear."</p>

<p>Hop-Wang looked up, and started; but instead
of being frightened, he showed every
sign of delight.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/gs048.png" width="136" height="350" alt="Look up quickly" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Red Dragon! the Red Dragon!" he cried. "Do you not
see the fluttering of his wings?" (Indeed, the Winds were blowing
the corners of the handkerchiefs, which were almost as large as small
tablecloths, in every direction, to screen the two children, so that they
really did look rather like flapping wings.) "I have prayed to
the Big Idol," he continued, addressing the woman, "ever since this
imp of wickedness here set fire to my beautiful pig-tail and burned it
off, to send one of his strong dragons to carry off my tormentor.
And now my prayers are answered, and the
Red Dragon, strongest of all, is here! Hokkaloo!
hokkaloo!" and he danced with delight.</p>

<p>But his joy was shortlived. The boy, as
soon as he heard the words "Red Dragon,"
and saw the fluttering wings, turned three
somersaults in succession, and was out of
sight in the twinkling of a satellite; and I,
thinking that distance would lend enchantment
to the view, and to be out of danger, begged the Winds to
blow the handkerchiefs up a mile or so. Accordingly the bright
vision receded gradually from the sight of the disappointed Chinaman,
and finally vanished, leaving him very disconsolate, and once
more at the mercy of his tormentor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/gs049.png" width="212" height="300" alt="Pun-Chin" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Mr Moonman!" said Brighteyes, as we rose slowly through the
clear air.</p>

<p>"Well, Mouse Brighteyes!" I said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Was that Pun-Chin?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was Pun-Chin!" I replied.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" said Brighteyes. And she was silent for
some time, thinking, perhaps, of the tail-feathers of the sixty-five
parrots.</p>

<p>"How delightful it will be," said Nibble; "to tell Uncle Jack and
the twinnies about this wonderful ride. Just think how surprised
they will be!" "There is a slight difficulty about that," I replied,
"which is that you will not remember in the morning a single thing
that has happened to-night." "Oh! Oh!" cried both the children,
"how can that be possible, Mr. Moonman? we <i>could</i> not forget all
these wonderful things, even if we tried, and we do not want to try."
"That is all very well," I replied, "but it will make no difference
whether you try or not, for all will be as I say. If you had carried
a sprig of the sea-flower in your hands it might have been otherwise;
but I take care never to give that to children, remembering what
trouble my cousin Patty once had from doing that very thing."</p>

<p>"Who is your cousin Patty?" asked Nibble. "Pray tell us about
her." The little Winds nodded their heads.</p>

<p>"We know all about her!" they said. "She is the Sea Fairy,
and lives in the palace which is hollowed out of a single pearl, under
the Indian Ocean. There are fine things there, Father Moonman!"</p>

<p>"You are right!" I said, "and some night these two mice
shall pay her a visit, and see for themselves. But as I was
saying, she got into trouble once, by giving a sprig of the sea-flower
to a little boy of whom she was very fond. I took him down to see
her one night, and she gave him many beautiful things, among them
a pair of diamond trousers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Diamond trousers!" exclaimed Nibble. "Who ever heard
of such things!"</p>

<p>"There are many things which you
have not heard of," I replied, "and
one seems to be that you are not to
interrupt when other people are
speaking."</p>

<p>Nibble hung his head and was
silent.</p>
<div class='center'> <table class="water" summary="water">
<tr><td align='left'>

<div class='blockquot7'>
<p>"She gave him," I
continued, "a pair of
diamond trousers, which
shone as brightly as
Whisk does when he
shakes himself. The
boy, a little English fellow
named Arthur, was
of course, very much
delighted, and putting
the trousers on, he capered
all about the
palace, kicking his little
legs up and down, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
make the diamonds sparkle more and more. 'Now there is a rule
among all the Light Ones (as we are called to distinguish us from
human beings,) that no heavy one shall ever be allowed to take
anything away with him when he comes to see us. It is a very
necessary rule, for there would be all kinds of trouble without it.
So on this occasion, if Patty had not given little Arthur the sea-flower,
all would have been well. He would have enjoyed his diamond
trousers while he was under the sea, and when he woke up in
the morning he would not have known anything about them. But
the poor little boy, having the sea-flower in his hand, woke up with
his head full of the past night, and fully expecting to find the
diamond trousers hanging over the back of a chair close by his bed.
When he looked, therefore, and saw nothing but his little brown
knickerbockers, with a patch on each knee, it was a bitter disappointment.
His first thought was that his beautiful present was
stolen, and he began to scream and cry: 'Where are my diamond
trousers? somebody has stolen them! stop thief! they are mine, and
Patty gave them to me!'</p></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/gs051.png" width="318" height="450" alt="In bed" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, his mother hearing those cries, came in, and on hearing the
child's story she thought he had gone mad, and was very anxious
about him. Still he cried and screamed for his diamond trousers;
but suddenly, as he raised his hand to push away the chair on which
the despised brown knickerbockers lay, he dropped the sea-flower!
Instantly everything about Patty and the diamond trousers passed
out of his mind like a flash of lightning, and looking up at his
mother, he said: 'What was I crying about, Mamma? Isn't it time
to get up?' And his mother said: 'Yes, my darling, it is high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
time to get up, and I think you have had the nightmare, Arthur
dear.'</p>

<p>"So you see,"
I continued,
"that it is not at
all a wise thing
to give the sea-flower
to little
people like you.
But, bless me!
here we are at
the Mouse-trap
again. Now, my
mice, creep into
your nests! say
good-by to the
little Winds, and
thank them for
blowing you so
far, for they must
be tired."</p>


<p>"Oh! thank
you! thank you! dear little Winds!" cried the two mice. "We
have had such a glorious ride, and we are so much obliged!
and thank you too, dear Mr. Moonman! will you come every night,
please, and tell us more wonderful things?"</p>

<p>"We will see about that!" I replied. "Every night is very often,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and there are many other children who look for me. But I will
come soon again, I promise you. Now good night, and a pleasant
waking to you!" and as Whisk and I flew upward, we heard the
seven little Winds singing softly, as they swung to and fro in the
grape-vine outside the nursery window:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The birds may sleep, but the winds must wake<br />
Early and late, for the birdies' sake;<br />
Kissing them, fanning them, soft and sweet,<br />
E'en till the dark and the dawning meet.<br />
<br />
The flowers may sleep, but the winds must wake<br />
Early and late, for the flowers' sake;<br />
Rocking the buds on the rose-mother's breast,<br />
Swinging the hyacinth-bells to rest.<br />
<br />
The children may sleep, but the winds must wake<br />
Early and late, for the children's sake;<br />
Singing so sweet in each little one's ear,<br />
He thinks his mother's own song to hear.<br />

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A RAINY DAY AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I suppose that is true!" said Brighteyes, who had been
singing this little song as she stood by the dining-room window after
breakfast, watching the rain. "I suppose it must rain some time.
But I do wish it would always rain at night, Uncle Jacket. Just
think how nice it would be!"</p>

<p>"Very nice for you," replied Uncle Jack. "But how about the
owls and bats, and watchmen and cats, who have to be out all night?
they might not fancy it quite so much. They might not like it," he
continued, "any more than I like to have a great boy and girl stand
and look out of the window, when my fire is hungry. Look at the
poor thing, almost starved for want of food!"</p>

<p>"Hi! Brighteyes," cried Nibble. "Which will get to the wood-box
first?" That was certainly a question, and it was also a question
whose neck would be broken first, to judge from the way in which
they rushed out of the room. But they came back safely, strange to
say, Nibble in advance, with a huge stick of yellow birch nearly as
large as himself, while Brighteyes followed closely with another.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Uncle Jack, rubbing his hands. "Now we shall see a
fire, for it is cold this morning, if it <i>is</i> the end of May. There," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
continued, placing the logs carefully, and heaping the coals over
them. "So my fire-spirit has his breakfast, as well as the rest of us.
He is an excellent fellow, and should be well treated. Did you ever
hear of the old woman who poked her fire-spirit till he ran away and
left her?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried the two mice. "Please tell us about her, Uncle."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs054.png" width="400" height="342" alt="Running" title="" />
</div>

<p>"She was a very cross old woman," said Uncle Jack. "She lived
all alone, for she was so cross that nobody could live with her. She
scolded her children till they went away, and she scolded her bird till
it flew away, and she scolded her cat till it ran away. So there she
lived all alone, with only the fire-spirit to keep her company. Now
her fire-spirit was very good natured, and had borne very patiently
with his mistress' ill-temper. One day, however, she came in looking
and feeling particularly savage. She sat down before the fire and
took up the poker.
'Ugh!' she said.
'What a miserable
attempt at a
fire! why don't
you burn, you stupid,
sulky thing?'
and she gave it a
vicious poke.</p>


<p>"How can I
burn," said the
fire, "when you
don't give me anything to burn with? nobody can make a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
blaze with only two sticks, and these two are as cross as you are,
which is saying a great deal."</p>

<p>"You <i>shall</i> burn!" cried the old hag, "whether you want to or
not!" and she began to poke and poke most unmercifully.</p>

<p>"Take care!" said the fire-spirit. "I can't stand much more of
this. I am growing black in the face."</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> teach you to answer me!" cried the woman, poking away
harder than ever. But suddenly she gave a shriek, and dropped the
poker. A puff of smoke came out of the fire-place. A shower of
cinders and sparks fell all over her, filling her eyes and nose and
mouth; a rushing sound, like a gust of wind, followed, and the
house-door was shut with a violent bang. Then all was silent. And
when the old hag had wiped the cinders out of her eyes, she saw
only a black cold hearth, with two cross sticks lying on it, and scowling
at each other. The fire-spirit was gone; and what was more, he
never came back, and the old woman had nothing to keep her warm,
except her own temper.</p>

<p>"And now, chickens," said Uncle Jack, "run away and study your
lessons, for this is our working-time, you know, and holidays are
over."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Brighteyes, "I wish we might have <i>one</i> more
story, Uncle Jack!"</p>

<p>"No! no!" said Uncle Jack. "There will be plenty of time for
stories to-day, for you will not be able to go out of doors. Trot,
now, for I have work to do as well as you."</p>

<p>Nibble and Brighteyes left the room slowly, and made their way to
the school-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, Brighteyes!" said Nibble, "suppose we play we are
somebody else, and then perhaps we shall like studying better."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean, Nibble?" asked Brighteyes.</p>

<p>"Why," said Nibble, "I have a geography lesson to study, and
you know I detest geography. But if I were to play I was Christopher
Columbus, I should have to <i>play</i> I liked it, because he must
have liked geography very much indeed, you know. So then it
might be easier, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Brighteyes, doubtfully. "It would be easier for
geography, certainly. But I have my arithmetic to study, and nobody
could ever have liked arithmetic, Nibble."</p>

<p>"You might be Mr. Colburn," suggested Nibble. "I suppose he
must have liked it, or he would not have written so much about it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/gs055.png" width="289" height="300" alt="Day-dreaming" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, I will try," said Brighteyes;
"though I don't think Mr. Colburn
is half as nice as Christopher Columbus.
But if he had been very nice,
he would not have written arithmetic
books, so it can't be helped, I suppose."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the
school-room, and Nibble, sitting
down by the big table and opening
his atlas, began, in a loud voice: "O King of Spain, let me inform
your Majesty that Alabama is bounded on the north by Tennessee,
on the east by Georgia, on the"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, Nibble! I Mean Christopher!" interrupted Mr. Colburn, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a piteous tone. "How can I do anything if you study out loud?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said the great discoverer, rather impatiently. "Well,
go ahead, Mr. Colburn, and write your book, while I go on a new
voyage of discovery. Let us see which will finish first."</p>

<p>And now, seeing that the mice were settling down to their books
in good earnest, I turned my attention to the nursery, where I rightly
judged that I should find the three younger mice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs056.png" width="450" height="395" alt="Washing" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, to be sure, what fine sport they were having, those three
little things! they had evidently been washing the dolls' clothes, for
small clothes-lines of string were all about the room, and Downy's
pinafore looked as if it had been in the tub: but now the wash was
all hung out, and the mice were "playing wind," as they called it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that is to say, they were running to and fro, puffing out their little fat
cheeks, and blowing at the clothes with might and main, in the hope
of making them dry sooner.</p>

<p>"I am the North Wind!" said Puff. "Whoop! whoop!"</p>

<p>"I am the South Wind!" cried Fluff.</p>

<p>"And I'm some kind of wind, ivn't I?" asked Downy, who was
blowing as hard as any of them.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you are the West Wind; whoop! whoop! whoop!"
said Puff, as she pranced about.</p>

<p>Now presently the door opened, and Mrs. Posset came in, with her
basket of stockings to mend. One of the clothes-lines was directly
in her way, and the good woman stumbled over it, and knocked her
head against the mantel-piece and dropped all the stockings. This
she did not like, as you may imagine. "Dear me! children," she
cried, "it's as much as my life is worth to enter this nursery, with all
your crinkum-crankums! my stars! will you look at the strings now,
all over the room, fit to break a body's neck! Whatever are you
doing now, Miss Puff?"</p>

<p>"We washed the dolls' clothes, Possy dear," said Puff, "because
they were dirty, and you said this morning dirt was a sin."</p>

<p>"So we couldn't have our children dirty and sinful too, you know,
Possy!" cried Fluff, earnestly. "And now we are playing wind,
and drying the clothes beautifully."</p>

<p>"Well, dears," said Mrs. Posset, resignedly, as she sat down with
her mending, "'tis a very nice play, no doubt; but if you <i>could</i> play
something that would not shake the room quite so much, the stockings
would be mended sooner, that's all."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Puffy," said Fluff, "what shall we play?"</p>

<p>"Oh! let us play 'Five Little Princesses'!" said Puff.</p>

<p>"But there are only three of us!" Fluff objected. "Unless Mrs.
Posset will be one, and <i>that</i> would only be four. <i>Would</i> you mind
being a princess, Possy?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Fluffy, dear, indeed I have not time, now," said the
good nurse; "but you might play that one of the princesses was
lame, and could not walk."</p>

<p>So the three mice began to walk slowly about, with their eyes shut,
singing, as they went:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Five little princesses started off to school,<br />
Following their noses because it was the rule.<br />
But one nose turned up, and another nose turned down,<br />
So all the little princesses were lost in the town.<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/gs057.png" width="300" height="301" alt="Five little princesses" title="" />
</div>

<p>Here they all tumbled
against each other, and
pretended to cry bitterly;
then starting off again,
they sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Poor little princesses cannot find their way!<br />
Naughty little noses, to lead them astray!<br />
Poor little princesses, sadly they roam,<br />
Naughty little noses, pray lead them home!<br />
</div>

<p>Now is not that a pretty game? Yes, and it is quite new, so you
may try it yourselves if you like. Just shut your eyes, and bump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
against all the chairs and tables, singing this song, and you will find
yourselves very much amused. At least, the twins and Downy enjoyed
it extremely, until Fluff, the unlucky, tripped over one of her
own clothes-lines, and fell against the stove (which, luckily, had no
fire in it,) hitting her head harder than even a lost princess could
possibly care to do. For a few minutes there was sorrow and confusion
among the princesses; but the offer of a story from Mrs.
Posset soon calmed their royal minds, and they gathered round the
good nurse's table with eager faces.</p>

<p>"Well, and what shall the story be about, Missies?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! about the three little girls!" said Puff. Fluff nodded her
head approvingly, and Downy said "Free ittle dirls!" in a satisfied
tone. So they listened, and I listened, and my dog listened. And
you may listen, too, if you like, though it is an old story, and you
may have heard it before.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, then," said Mrs. Posset, threading her darning-needle,
and taking up one of Nibble's stockings, which was in
such a condition as might have made a darning-machine turn pale,
"there were three little girls, and their names were Orange and
Lemon and Hold-your-tongue. And they all lived together in a little
red house with a green roof, which stood in the middle of a wood.
Now every morning there was the work to be done, you see. So on
Monday morning Orange would get up at the break of day, so to
speak, and she swept the house, and she made the fire, and she
cooked the breakfast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did they have for breakfast?" asked Fluff.</p>

<p>"Pork chops," said Mrs. Posset. "And then she called her sisters;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and when they had eaten their breakfast, they all went out and
played for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>"Well, and on Tuesday morning Lemon got up early. And she
swept the house, and she made the fire, and she cooked the breakfast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did they have <i>that</i> morning?" interrupted Puff.</p>

<p>"Cod's head and shoulder!" replied Mrs. Posset. "And then
she called her sisters; and when they had eaten their breakfast, they
all went out and played for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>"Well, my dears, as I'm telling you, on Wednesday, the third little
girl&mdash;dear! dear! what was her name now? I seem to forget&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold-your-tongue!" cried Fluff, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" said Mrs. Posset, pretending to be very much
vexed. "To think of your having no better manners than that, Miss
Fluff! telling me to hold my tongue, indeed! not another story will
you get from me to-day, I promise you!"</p>

<p>This was a favorite joke of Mrs. Posset's, I found, and the children
were never tired of it, though they knew that the little story went no
further than "Hold your tongue!" They were still laughing over
it, when they heard a loud scream from below, followed by a heavy
fall, and a crash as of broken china. For a moment they all looked
at each other in silence, startled by the shock; then Mrs. Posset put
Downy off her knee, and flew down stairs, followed by the three
little mice, all eager to know what had happened. Uncle Jack had
heard the noise in his study, and Susan had heard it in the kitchen;
in fact, the whole household was roused, and all turned their steps
towards the school-room, where Nibble and Brighteyes were. Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Jack was the first to open the door, and when he looked into the
room, he saw&mdash;see! I will draw you a picture. <i>This</i> is what he saw.
Nibble was lying on the floor, apparently half-stunned, while near
him lay the fragments of a china teapot; and all around on the
floor, were scattered gold coins, large and small, hundreds and hundreds
of them. Every one stood astonished, very naturally, and no
one was more astonished than Master Nibble himself. As soon as
he recovered his composure a little, he sat up on Uncle Jack's knee,
and told his story, very much in these words:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs058.png" width="400" height="278" alt=" Nibble on the floor" title="" />
</div>

<p>"It was all my geography lesson, Uncle!" said Nibble. "I
played I was Christopher Columbus, so that I should like it better,
and I learned it all, every word of it. But I finished before Mr.
Colburn had written his books, so I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! Nibble!" cried Uncle Jack. "Who is Mr. Colburn,
pray? and what has he to do with your geography lesson?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, he is Brighteyes!" said Nibble. "To make her like her
arithmetic lesson, don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed!" said Uncle Jack. "Go on, Christopher!"</p>

<p>"So," continued Nibble, "I thought I would go on a voyage of
discovery, a <i>real</i> voyage. And I saw that little trap door in the
ceiling, that you said must be an old sky-light covered over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that I forbade you to meddle with," said Uncle Jack, quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, Uncle, I know you did. But if Columbus had minded
what other people said, would he ever have found America?"</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Uncle Jack, trying to suppress a smile. "Well,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," responded Nibble, "so I thought I would sail for that
port. I climbed up on some things" (I should say he did! there was
a heap of tables and chairs, desks and books, sofa-pillows and coal-scuttles,
under the open trap-door, which was enough to frighten
one,) "and got into it. It was a kind of an attic place, Uncle, all
beams and rafters and cobwebs. I crept in ever so far on my hands
and knees, and in the farthest corner I found a heap of queer old
clothes all covered with dust; coats and hats, and all sorts of things.
I knew they must belong to the queer old man Tomty told us about,
who used to live here, and I thought it would be great fun to bring
them down and dress up in them. I lifted some of them, and heard
something rattle underneath: then I looked, and found that old teapot,
hidden away under a great beam. It was very heavy, and the
cover was fastened on with sealing-wax, so I was going to bring it
down to you; but my foot slipped, and&mdash;" "And you came down
rather faster than you meant to?" said Uncle Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear to goodness, sir!" cried Mrs. Posset, who had been picking
up the gold pieces, and had her apron full of them. "It's my
belief that this is neither more nor less than old Jonas Junk's
treasure, of which the neighbors talk so much."</p>

<p>"It certainly is, Mrs. Posset!" replied Uncle Jack. "And I think
we must always call Nibble Christopher Columbus, for he certainly
has made a great discovery!"</p>

<h3>A STORY CHAPTER.</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs060.png" width="450" height="345" alt="Alseep" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was quite late one evening when I slipped in at a window in the
Mouse-trap, to pay a visit to Nibble and Brighteyes. Nibble's bed,
a most intelligent piece of furniture, walked in from the other room
of its own accord, as soon as I appeared, so I had not even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
trouble of calling it. As for the two mice, they fairly squeaked with
delight when they saw me. "Oh! Mr. Moonman!" they cried,
"we thought you were never coming again! where have you been
all this long, long time?"</p>

<p>"It is only a week since I last came, little mice!" I replied;
"and indeed, I should have been here oftener, but two of my pet
children have been ill, and I have been telling them stories every
night, to make the time pass more quickly."</p>

<p>"Oh! tell us about them, and tell us their names, and tell us the
stories you told them!" cried Brighteyes eagerly.</p>

<p>"And take us on another journey, oh! <i>please!</i>" added Nibble,
jumping up and down, with excitement.</p>

<p>"How is a poor Moonman to do everything at once?" I inquired.
"In the first place, there will be no traveling to-night, let me tell
you. A very disagreeable Wind has the watch to-night, and I
would not trust you in his hands. Yes, he is a detestable fellow,
very different from our seven little friends of the other night. He
actually tried to blow out my lantern, which is a piece of impudence
I have seldom met with. You shall hear a story about him if you
will, for only last night I was telling one to Marie and Emil."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" cried the mice; "we should like it above all
things. But first tell us a little about Marie and Emil. Are they
the two children who have been ill?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied; "they are French children, and they live in a
sea-board town in the south of France,&mdash;that is, they live there
about half the time: the other half they spend on the water, in their
father's yacht. Their father is a rich man, who has a passion for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sea, and likes to spend most of his time on it: and he takes his little
boy and girl with him on many of his yacht voyages, for they are as
fond of the water as he is, and they have no mother."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs061.png" width="400" height="304" alt="Sailing ship" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh!" sighed Nibble, "I wish Uncle Jack had a yacht, and a
passion for the sea!"</p>

<p>"That would be admirable!" said I. "Two children on a yacht
are all very well, but if there were five, the captain and all the crew
would jump overboard and drown themselves, I fancy. Certainly,
Marie and Emil are very happy on board the Victoria. Marie has a
cabin of her own, the prettiest little room you can imagine, where
she sits and reads, or swings in her hammock, when she is tired of
staying on deck. The sailors are all devoted to them, and now that
they are ill on shore, the big captain, Jacques Legros, goes every
day up to the house, to ask if 'the little angels are better?'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the matter with them?" asked Brighteyes; "and shall
we have the story now, if you please?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs062.png" width="450" height="362" alt="In a hammock" title="" />
</div>

<p>"You shall have the story now!" I said, "and they have had the
scarlet fever, but are doing very well. Hear that angry Wind outside!
how he howls, and shakes the window-frame. He knows that
I am going to tell you about his misdeeds. Howl away, my friend;
you can do us no harm. So then I told the mice the following
story. First, however, I showed them a picture of Marie, which I
happened to have in my pocket. They thought she was a very
pretty little girl. What do you think?"</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF THE WIND.</h3>

<p>The great Tree stood out in the green meadow, all alone. No
other trees dared to come near him, he was so strong, and tall, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
grand; but for all that, he was kind and gentle, and never would
hurt anything. One morning the great Tree awoke from his long
winter sleep, and found the snow all gone, and the sun shining
bright and warm as if it were June instead of the first of April. On
his branches were sitting a flock of little birds, and it was their
chirping and twittering that had waked him. "Chippity-wippity pip
pip, cheepy peepy weep wee-e-e!" they said; and that meant
"Wake up, old Tree! Spring has sent us to call you. She is coming
directly, and she wants you to get your leaves out as soon as possible,
as she has forgotten her parasol, and wants some shade for her pretty
head."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/gs063.png" width="375" height="500" alt="MARIE." title="" />
<span class="caption">MARIE.</span>
</div>

<p>The great Tree nodded his head, and said, "Tell my lady Spring
that I will be ready." And then he shook his branches, and called
out, "Little leaves, little children, open your buds and come out!
come out!" And one by one the little buds with which the branches
were covered opened, and out popped the little leaves. At first they
shivered, and wished themselves back in their warm little houses;
but the old Tree spoke kindly to them, and then the sunbeams came
and kissed them, so that they felt quite happy, and even began to
dance about a little on the branches. And they said to each other,
"How foolish we were, to think of shutting ourselves up again in
those close houses. Here we shall be free and happy, and we will
dance all day and all night."</p>

<p>Just then they heard a soft voice whispering, "Little leaves, lovely
leaves, will you not dance with me?" And the little leaves said,
"Who are you, that whispers so softly?" And the voice answered,
"I am the Wind, and I have come to be your playfellow. I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sing, too, and sweetly, and we shall all be happy together." So the
Wind sang them a low, sweet song; and then he danced with them,
and kissed them gently, and played with them; and they all said,
"Oh, dear, gentle Wind, how charming you are! will you not play
with us every day, and make us happy?"</p>

<p>But after the Wind had flown away, the old Tree called to them
and said, "My children, beware of the Wind, for he is not to be
trusted. Soft and gentle he is to-day, but to-morrow he may be
fierce and terrible. Play with him and dance with him, but be always
on your guard." And the little leaves nodded their little heads, and
answered, "Yes, good father, we will be careful."</p>

<p>Well, for many days the Wind came to play with the leaves, and
every day they thought him more delightful. Such wonderful stories
as he told them! of all the strange countries he had seen in his
wanderings; the beautiful tropical islands, where he slept all day in
the palm-tree tops, just waking in the evening to fan the cheeks of
the dark-eyed southern ladies for an hour, and then sinking to sleep
again under the shining stars; and the terrible northern seas, with
their fleets of icebergs, whose pilot he loved to be, guiding them
hither and thither, tossing the waves about, and sporting with the
seals and walruses on the flat ice-cakes. "And some day, little
leaves," he said, "you shall go with me to see these wonders; not to
the arctic seas, for you are too tender and delicate to bear the cold;
but away to the south, to the coral islands and the orange-groves.
There you will see all the beauty of the world, and will laugh at the
thought of having been content in this dull meadow, with its stupid
daisies and buttercups, and its paltry little brook. Also you will find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
many cousins there, leaves such as you never dreamed of, wonderful
in size and shape and color. Say, then, little playmates, will you
come with me, and see all these beautiful things, and many more?"</p>

<p>But the leaves shook their little heads, and said, "No, dear Wind!
we love you, and it would be delightful to go with you, but we cannot
leave our father Tree, who is so kind to us, and loves us so dearly."</p>

<p>At first the Wind seemed angry, but soon he smiled and said,
"Never mind! some day you will come,&mdash;some day!" and away he
flew. But oh! the next time he came, what a different Wind he
was! no longer gentle, playful, caressing, but fierce, and rough, and
stormy. He rushed at the great Tree, howling furiously. He seized
the little leaves, and whirled and dashed them about, trying to tear
them from the branches; and flung himself against the Tree, as if he
would even loose his rooted hold on the ground. But the leaves
clung closer and closer, trembling and shivering; and the great Tree
braced himself, and met the fierce blast bravely, never losing an inch
of his foothold, and giving back blow for blow with his long powerful
arms. At last the Wind was tired and flew away, howling and
moaning with anger and disappointment. The little leaves were
sadly frightened, but their father Tree comforted them, and said,
"Courage, my children! I have fought many a battle with the
Wind, and he has never beaten me yet. Only be brave and faithful,
and he cannot overcome you."</p>

<p>At first the leaves thought they never wanted to see or hear the
Wind again; but a few days after, to their great surprise, he came
again, soft and gentle, as he had used to be, and he kissed them and
sang to them, and begged them to forgive his wicked temper, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
play with him once more. He was so charming that they soon forgave
him, and soon forgot all about the storm. And they danced
and frolicked about gayly, and listened again to the marvelous tales
of far-off countries, of palm-groves and coral islands.</p>

<p>So the time went on and on. The Lady Spring had gathered
her green robes about her and passed on, and her children, the wildwood
blossoms, had followed her; and now Lady Summer, who had
come in her stead, with her arms full of peaches and pears, and her
gown covered with lovely garden flowers, was almost ready to depart,
and stayed lingering, calling and beckoning to her brother Autumn,
who was following very slowly. The leaves on the great Tree had
been very happy during Lady Summer's reign. Many a time, it is
true, the Wind had been angry with them, because they refused to go
away with him, and again and again he had raged and stormed, and
tried to tear them away from their happy home. But he was always
very sorry after these fits of passion, and they always forgave him
readily, for they loved him dearly.</p>

<p>One night, one clear, lovely night, when all things were sleeping
in the moonlight, the Wind came and whispered to the leaves. So
softly he came, and so softly he spoke, that they did not wake at first,
and he had to kiss them all before he could rouse them from their
sleep. "Hush, darlings!" he said. "You must not wake the old
Tree, for I have a secret to tell you which he must not hear. Something
very wonderful is going to happen, and I have come to tell you
about it." "What is it, dear Wind? oh, what is it?" whispered the
little leaves. And they clustered together and listened. "Well, my
darlings," said the Wind, "a very great personage is going to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
through this part of the country to-morrow night. No less a personage
than the celebrated Frost, the court painter of the great King
Winter. He is one of the most famous painters in the world, but he
is also a great friend of mine; and though he is in a hurry to join
his royal master, who has now left his Arctic kingdom, and is traveling
southward, he has kindly consented to do a great favor for you, my
darlings, because I have told him how dearly I love you."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear Wind? oh, what is it?" asked the little leaves
again.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Wind, "I know you must be very tired of these
dull green dresses. They were well enough in the spring, when
they were new and fresh, but now you have been wearing them all
summer, and they are dirty and soiled. So I have persuaded my
friend Frost to stop here on his way through the meadow, and to
paint you all over, with fresh, new, beautiful colors. Only think of
it, darlings! think how lovely you will look, all shining in crimson
and gold! Now, am I not a good friend? and will you not all give
me kisses for this?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! yes indeed, you good Wind!" cried the leaves. "We
will give you as many kisses as you want, and we will thank you till
you are tired of being thanked. Oh! how delightful it will be!"
and they danced about and about, and they kissed the Wind, and he
kissed them.</p>

<p>"And now, good-night!" he said. "Remember, not a word of
this to the old Tree, for it would be a pity to rob him of the pleasure
of such a charming surprise."</p>

<p>He flew away, but the leaves were too happy to go to sleep again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
They whispered and chattered all night about their new dresses.
This one would have yellow, and that one would have pink, and that
one scarlet, while some of the older ones preferred a rich golden
russet. And when morning came, they were still whispering and
chattering, and could think of nothing else all day.</p>

<p>At last the wished-for night came; and a beautiful night it was,
very cool, but perfectly still, and brilliant with moonlight and starlight.
The little leaves waited and waited, till they were, oh! so
sleepy! but no one came. At length, when their eyes were closing
in spite of themselves, they felt a sudden cold strike them, a cold so
intense that it almost took away their breath. They looked up, and
saw advancing over the meadow towards them, a strange figure
which they knew in a moment must be that of the great Frost. He
was very tall and thin, and very pale; and his long robe, and his
hair, and his long curling moustaches, looked exactly like silver.
Indeed, there was a silvery glitter all about and around him, and as
he passed lightly over the grass, it too seemed to them to silver under
his feet. He came straight on, came to the tree. Then, without
speaking a word, he drew out a long silver brush which had been
hidden beneath his robe, and a palette covered with brilliant colors,
and began to paint the leaves. But oh! what a deadly chill struck
through them when the silver brush touched them. Cold, cold, cold!
and a kind of numbness, and a heavy drowsiness, began to creep over
them. But when they saw the gorgeous beauty of their new dresses,
they were very proud, and tried to hold themselves up, and not to
give way to this strange weakness and faintness. And at last, oh!
at last, the final touch was given, and with one cold farewell glance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
from his bright, sharp eyes, the court painter of the great King
Winter passed on over the meadow.</p>

<p>Soon morning broke, and the leaves, waking from their brief and
uneasy slumber, looked around to see the splendor in which they
were arrayed. How the sun stared at them, when he rose. He sent
down a special sunbeam to give them his compliments and to say
that he had never seen them look so charming. Oh! very proud
were the little leaves, and very happy, they thought; but somehow
they did not feel at all well. The day was bright and warm, and yet
they were so cold, so cold! and the numbness and weakness still
seemed creeping over them, and would not now be shaken off. And
now the great Tree awoke, (for he was apt to sleep late, being very
old.) But instead of being pleased, as his children thought he
would be, when he saw their fine appearance, he sighed and wept.</p>

<p>"Ah, my children!" he said; "my poor unhappy children! I see
what has happened. You have listened to the Wind, and the Frost
has been with you; and now you will leave me, and I shall be alone
again, as I have been so many, many years."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! Father Tree," cried the leaves, "we will stay
with you always."</p>

<p>But the old Tree shook his head, and said, "No, my children! it
is too late. You cannot choose now whether you will go or stay, and
soon, soon I shall be left alone."</p>

<p>The little leaves did not understand this, and they tried to forget
the sad words, and to be happy with their fine new dresses. But
still they were so cold, so cold! and still the drowsy numbness kept
creeping, creeping over them, and each day they became weaker and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
weaker. And one day, oh! one fearful day, the Wind came.
Fiercely and furiously he flew across the meadow, savagely he
rushed at the great Tree. "Now," he howled, "now, little leaves,
will you come with me? ha! ha! <i>now</i> will you come?" he clutched
the leaves, and they shivered and moaned, and clung to the branches.
But alas! their strength was gone, they could no longer resist the
blast: and in a moment they were whirled away and away, borne
hither and thither on the wings of the mighty Wind, and at last
dashed down on the earth, to shiver and die in the cold.</p>

<p>And once more the great Tree stood alone in the meadow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>A PICNIC.</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs065.png" width="450" height="314" alt="Man sitting on the ground" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> bright morning, at about eleven o'clock, I tipped my glass in
the direction of the Mouse-trap. It had been tipped in a very different
direction, for I had been watching a buffalo-hunt on the
prairies. That is an exciting sport, and one that I should like to
join in, if I were a few thousand years younger. Here at the Mouse-trap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
however, there was an excitement of quite another sort. All
the five mice were hurrying about, evidently very busy. The carriage
stood at the door, and Uncle Jack was packing all sorts of
things into it. Nibble brought one big basket, and Puff brought
another, and both were stowed away under the seat. Brighteyes
came down the steps very carefully carrying something in a pitcher,
with a napkin tied over the top, and that too was stowed away. As
for Fluff and Downy, they were running round and round the house
as fast as they could,
shouting: "Picnic! picnic!
going to a picnic!
oh! Jollykaloo! Jollykaloo!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/gs066.png" width="300" height="299" alt="Running to get ready" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Aha!" I said to my
dog, "the mice are
going to have a picnic.
Let us watch now, and
see where they go: and
then we shall have all the
fun of it, and none of the
trouble." So we watched, and saw them all get into the carriage
except Nibble, who stood on the steps with his hands in his pockets,
evidently waiting for something. The something soon proved to be
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>, the brown donkey, whom Thomas now led up the path, looking
very gay with his Mexican saddle and scarlet tassels. Nibble mounted
him nimbly, and took the reins and the whip. "Thank you, Tomty!"
he said. "And good-bye! I wish you were going to the picnic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Tomty!" "Thank you kindly, sir!" replied Tomty. "The hens
and me will be having a picnic in the barn-yard, Master Nibble, I'm
thinking."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Jack, I am ready!" cried the young horseman. "I
will lead the way, and you can follow!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Uncle Jack, who was holding in the spirited
horses with some difficulty, "you are extremely kind, I am sure!"</p>

<p>"Get up, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>!" cried Nibble, "Hi! go on, sir!" But <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>
was not inclined to go on. He shook his head, and pointed his long
ears backward and forward, but not a step would he stir, for entreaties,
threats, or blows. Then Tomty slyly took a sharp-pointed stake,
and poked Master <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins> from behind. Ah, that was another matter!
up went his heels in the air, and off he went at full gallop, while all
the occupants of the carriage shouted with laughter, as they saw
donkey and rider dash along the avenue, and finally vanish in a cloud
of dust.</p>

<p>"Come, Pollux! come, Castor!" said Uncle Jack, "it would
never do for the donkey to get to the Glen before us."</p>

<p>Castor and Pollux thought so too, for they tossed their heads, and
quickened their pace to a fast trot, though they were far too well
behaved to think of breaking into a gallop.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/gs067.png" width="314" height="300" alt="Looking at flowers" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh! isn't it nice to go so fastly?" exclaimed Fluffy, giving
Downy a hug. "Just like queens in their chariots. See those two
little tiny children, Downy! They are smaller as you, and perhaps
they think we are queens, only we haven't any crowns; but we might
have left our crowns at home for fear of robbers."</p>

<p>"Yef, wobbers!" said Downy, with a knowing nod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"No I don't think we will be queens," said Brighteyes. "Let us
be wild beasts in a caravan,
going to the menagerie,
and then we can
sing the menagerie song."
"Oh! yes! yes!" cried
all the others. And then
they sang the following
song, each singing a
verse in turn, and then
imitating the voice of the
creature she represented
while the other verses
were sung. It was a lively game, you may believe.</p>


<div class='poem'>
The Tiger is a terrible beast!<br />
He lives in jungles of the East,<br />
On bad little boys he loves to feast:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! fiddledy, diddledy, dido!</span><br />
<br />
The Lion he doth rage and roar;<br />
And when he hits you with his paw,<br />
You never are troubled with nothing no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! fiddledy, diddledy, dido!</span><br />
<br />
The Buffalo doth proudly prance,<br />
Whenever the hunters will give him a chance,<br />
And over the prairies he leads them a dance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! fiddledy, diddledy, dido!</span><br />
<br />
The Crocodile doth open his jaws,<br />
Like great big ugly tusky doors,<br />
And gobbles you up without a pause,<br />

<p>By the time the last verse was finished the four mice were howling
and roaring in a manner frightful to hear, and Uncle Jack's patience
finally gave way. "Children," he said, turning round, "I cannot
possibly endure this. Be quiet at once, or I will drive you to the
Lunatic Asylum and leave you there! See, the people are all
coming out of their houses to stare at you!" So indeed they were,
and one little girl, who stood with her mother at a cottage gate,
staring with might and main, cried: "Them's all mad, be'nt them,
mother?" "No, little girl!" said Puff, with great dignity. "We
are wild beasts going to a menagerie!" And the carriage whirled
away leaving the child not much
the wiser.</p>

<p>Now they turned into a lovely
wood road, when the trees bent
down over the carriage, and whispered
in the mice's ears. But
the mice did not understand, as
usual; they only rubbed their
ears and said the leaves tickled
them. Uncle Jack stopped the
horses, and told the mice to tumble
out, which they did speedily.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 224px;">
<img src="images/gs069.png" width="224" height="350" alt="Primrose" title="" />
</div>

<p>One took a basket, and another
a bottle, and all went trotting
down the mossy path that led
to the lovely glen, while Uncle
Jack stayed to unharness the horses, and then followed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
"biggy-wiggy basket," as Downy called it. Indeed, it was a pretty
sight to see those little creatures, playing about like so many fairies
in that lovely green place. You should have seen the little flower-spirits
start up to look at them, as they frisked about among the
trees. Little Primrose threw kisses to them, and Violet offered them
a dew-drop in her deepest purple cup; but the merry mice thought
nothing of the flower spirits and neither saw nor heard them.</p>

<p>"Oh! the brook! the lovely brook!" cried Brighteyes. "We
<i>must</i> take off our shoes and stockings and wade in it. Mayn't we,
Uncle Jack?" Uncle Jack
nodded, and off went four
pairs of shoes, and four pairs
of scarlet stockings. Oh?
the little white feet! how
pretty they looked, shining
through the clear water, that
looked so brown in the still
pools, and sparkled so white
over the rocks and the tiny
rapids.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/gs070.png" width="308" height="350" alt="Violet" title="" />
</div>

<p>That was fine sport, certainly.
Fluff fell in, of course,
but nobody seemed to mind it much, and Fluff herself least of all, for
it was a very warm day, and Mrs. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Possett'">Posset</ins> was not there to lament
the "ruination" of her white frock.</p>

<p>Suddenly Brighteyes exclaimed: "But where is Nibble?" Sure
enough, where was that famous horseman? nobody had seen him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
since he had galloped away up the avenue. "Oh, dear!" sighed
Fluff, "perhaps he played wild beast, and somebody took him and
put him in the Lunatic Asylum! Do you think anybody did, Uncle
Jack?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he would be likely to play wild beast all alone.
My fear is that <i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins></i> may have been playing, and&mdash;&mdash;but see!" he
added, looking back towards the path by which they had entered the
glen, "here comes the young man himself, so now we shall know
all about it."</p>

<p>Nibble came down the path slowly, looking very serious. His
clothes were covered with dust, his hat was battered out of all shape,
and he carried his whip under his arm, instead of snapping it gayly
as he had done when he started. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins> was not to be seen.</p>

<p>"Well, Nibble, my boy, what has happened?" asked Uncle Jack,
cheerily. "Has <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins> been rolling with you again?" "Yes, Uncle!"
answered Nibble, as he drew near, and threw himself on the mossy
bank where his uncle was seated, "he is the worst donkey I ever
saw! he wanted some thistles in the hedge, and I wouldn't let him
eat them, of course. So then he kicked and reared, but he couldn't
get me off <i>that</i> way, and I whipped him a good bit. But then he
lay down and rolled, and then I <i>couldn't</i> stay on you see!" "I
see!" said Uncle Jack. "You were certainly justified in getting off.
And then <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins> went home, I suppose?" "Well, yes, I suppose he
did," said Nibble, reluctantly, "and I have walked a long way,
Uncle, and I want my dinner." "Bless me!" cried Uncle Jack,
"dinner already? Well, come out of the water, you little Nixies,
and let us see about our grand feast!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Patter, patter, came all the little white feet, over the mossy stones,
and over the green turf, and I could not tell whether they looked
prettier in the water or out of it. There was a rush for the baskets,
and their contents were tumbled out pell-mell on the grass. Forks,
spoons, tarts, sandwiches, lemons, followed each other in rapid
succession.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/gs071.png" width="349" height="350" alt="Gathering flowers" title="" />
</div>
<p>"Now this will never do!" said Uncle Jack. "Too many cooks
spoil the broth, as we know, and we must not spoil our feast.
Nibble, do you go and gather brush and make a fire. Hap and
Hazard shall pick some flowers to make wreaths and posies, and
Brighteyes shall help me to set the table." "And what fell I do?"
asked little Downy, piteously; "I muf do fomefing!" "So you
shall, Downy," said
Uncle Jack; "you
shall chase all the butterflies
away, so that
they will not eat up
the tarts."</p>



<p>Now every one was
happy and busy. The
twinnies wandered off
into the meadow near
by, filling their aprons
with posies, and chattering
merrily, with little
snatches of song mingling with their pretty talk. It was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pleasan'">pleasant</ins>
to hear their sweet voices singing:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
Daisy white and Daisy bright,<br />
And Daisy is my heart's delight!<br />
I'll twine you now in my true-love's hair,<br />
And tell me who is the fairest fair!<br />
<br />
Violet blue and Violet true,<br />
And Violet filled with diamond dew!<br />
I'll give you now to my true love here,<br />
And tell me who is the dearest dear!<br />
</div>

<p>Meanwhile great things were accomplished in the glen. A snowy
cloth was spread on the emerald turf, and on it were arrayed all the
good things, in dishes and plates, which had been lately hanging on
the great sycamore-tree under which the feast was spread.</p>

<p>"Nothing like leaves for picnic-plates!" said Uncle Jack. "Now
then, Brighteyes, hand out that chicken pie! So! now for the
strawberries and the sponge cake! ha! this certainly does make one
hungry." Indeed it did, as I felt the pangs of hunger merely from
seeing all the good things in my mirror. "Go, good dog," I said to
my faithful companion, "and bring me some ice-cream from Mt.
Vanilla. And dip the ladle into that syllabub cloud that is drifting
by, for it will make a pleasant addition."</p>

<p>Bmfkgth departed on his errand, and I turned again to watch the
picnic. The kettle was boiling by this time over Nibble's brush fire,
and he was calling for the coffee-pot, when suddenly a shrill scream
was heard from the meadow, and Downy's voice cried, "Fomebody
come! oh! oh! I'm killed!" Brighteyes ran to the rescue, and
found the little man gazing in terror at a very innocent-looking
white cow, who was quietly grazing in the meadow. He ran to his
sister, and clung to her, crying, "Dat cow looked at me! I'm killed!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Brighteyes took his hand and ran back laughing. "Here is a boy
who has been killed by a cow's looking at him," she said, "and he
wants a sandwich."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs072.png" width="450" height="286" alt="Cowing looking" title="" />
</div>

<p>All was ready now. The twins were called, and came back laden
with flowers; Nibble came with his coffee-pot, and the grand feast
began in earnest. Dear! dear! how good everything looked!
chicken pie and smoked tongue and sandwiches, and chocolate custard
in a pitcher, and everything else that you can think of. I
never have chicken pie up here, because there are no chickens, but I
think it must be very nice, and it was very evident that the mice
thought so. Uncle Jack carved and helped, and everybody ate and
drank and chattered merrily. My brother Sun smiled at them, and
sent millions of sunbeams, twinkling and sparkling over the grass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and dancing on the ripples of the brook; and when they were too
warm, hosts of merry Winds came flying, and fanned them and
kissed them. Among them were the seven little fellows who had
blown Nibble and Brighteyes to China, and they whispered, "Dear
little Heavy-Ones; will you take another flying-trip with us?" but
the children did not hear nor heed them, so nothing further was said.</p>

<p>When the feast was over, there was a grand washing of spoons and
forks, and a putting away of what was good and throwing away of
what was bad. Then came blind-man's-buff, and hide-and-seek, and
all manner of games; and then more paddling and tumbling in the
brook, splashing and dashing, "for all the world like the forty little
ducklings!" Uncle Jack said. "Oh! tell us about the little
ducklings!" cried all the mice. And they climbed up the bank and
sat down in a circle round their uncle, holding up their wet feet to
dry in the sun. "About the ducklings, eh?" said Uncle Jack,
"well, let me see if I can remember."</p>

<div class='poem2'>
The forty little ducklings who lived up at the farm,<br />
They said unto each other, "oh! the day is <i>very</i> warm!"<br />
They said unto each other, "oh! the river's <i>very</i> cool!<br />
The duck who did not seek it now would surely be a fool!"<br />
<br />
The forty little ducklings they started down the road,<br />
And waddle, waddle, waddle, was the gait at which they goed,<br />
The same it is not grammar, you may change it if you choose!<br />
But one cannot stop for trifles when inspired by the Muse.<br />
<br />
They waddled and they waddled, and they waddled on and on,<br />
Till one remarked, "oh! deary me, where <i>is</i> the river gone?<br />
We asked the Ancient Gander, and he said 'twas very near,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>He must have been deceiving us, or else himself, I fear."<br />
<br />
They waddled and they waddled, till no further they could go,<br />
Then down upon a mossy bank they sat them in a row.<br />
They took their little handkerchiefs and wept a little weep,<br />
And then they put away their heads, and then they went to sleep.<br />
<br />
There came along a farmer, with a basket on his arm,<br />
And all those little ducklings he took back to the farm,<br />
He put them in their little beds and wished them sweet repose,<br />
And fastened mustard plasters on their little webby toes.<br />
<br />
Next day those little ducklings were very, very ill,<br />
Their mother sent for Dr. Quack, who gave them each a pill,<br />
But soon as they recovered, the first thing that they did<br />
Was to peck the Ancient Gander, till he ran away and hid.<br />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/gs073.png" width="348" height="300" alt="Duck" title="" />
</div>

<p>"There!" said Uncle Jack, "weren't they funny ducklings?"
"Yes!" said Puff; "is it true, Uncle?" "Part of it is," replied
Uncle Jack. "It is true
about the ducklings running
away, and about the
farmer's finding them. I
know the farmer. His
name is Mr. Thomas Burnham,
and a very good
farmer he is. But I did
not see him put the mustard
plasters on their feet,
so I cannot tell about that." "Then tell us something else, please!"
cried Brighteyes. "No! no!" said Uncle Jack; "it is six o'clock,
you bad children! Once upon a time there were five little mice,
and it was time for them to go home. That is the only story I can
tell you now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 311px;">
<img src="images/gs074.png" width="311" height="325" alt="Holding hands" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, to be sure, it did seem a shame to go home, just when
everything was so lovely. But Downy was beginning to rub his
eyes as if my friend the Sand-man had been blowing into them, and
the shadows were lengthening, and Brother Sun was beginning to
call his beams home. So the mice bade farewell to the lovely glen,
and the merry brook, and trotted up the mossy path as cheerfully, if
not as quickly as they had trotted down it. Harum-scarum and flyaway
my mice certainly are, but they are almost always cheerful and
obedient, and that is a great
thing. Primrose and Violet
and the rest looked after
them, and said, "God bless
their merry hearts!" then
they curled down under their
leaves and went to sleep, for
it was high time. The brook
sang its sweetest good-bye
song, as it hurried away toward
the sea, to tell the gossipping
waves what a delightful afternoon it had passed; and as if in answer
to the song, I heard Puff and Fluff singing merrily, as the carriage
rolled away:</p>


<div class='poem'><br />
"Rosebud fine and Rosebud mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Rosebud red as the ruby wine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll lay you now at my true-love's feet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tell me who is the sweetest sweet!"</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE CARRIAGE CLOUD.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Good</span> evening to you all!" I said, as I stepped in at the nursery
window. "This is a night for a journey, if you please. All the
rough and unruly Winds are out of the way, for there is to be a
match to-night between the North-east wind and a Southern tornado,
to see which can blow the harder, and all their relations have gone to
look on. But our seven little friends have no liking for such rough
bear-play, and they are waiting outside, with a carriage-cloud which
will hold you all. So jump up, and call Nibble and Brighteyes. But
first, I must know why my Fluff has been crying. You must have
cried yourself to sleep, my mouse, and that will never do. Tell your
old Moonman what has happened, for I have been watching a battle
in Zululand all day, and have seen neither mice nor mouse-trap."</p>

<p>"We have had a very melancholy day, Mr. Moonman!" replied
Fluff, "Vashti Ann has been hanged, and it is a terrible thing to
hang your own child, even if Nibble does it for you." "Vashti Ann
hanged!" I exclaimed. "Dear! dear! how very distressing! what
had she done, pray, and how did it all happen?" "We don't think
she meant to do it," said Puff gravely; "but Nibble said she ought to
be hanged all the same. You see, we had just dressed the baby"&mdash;"and
she was Vashti Ann's <i>own</i> child!" Fluff broke in impressively.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/gs075.png" width="377" height="500" alt="FLUFF." title="" />
<span class="caption">FLUFF.</span>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/gs076.png" width="352" height="350" alt="Sewing" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Please do not interrupt me, Fluffy!" said <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pluffy'">Puffy</ins> with dignity.
"And we set her down in front of her mother, and told her to say
her lesson like a good baby, only she can't really say it, you know,
but we play she does. So then Fluffy went for a walk with the other
dolls, but I had to darn a hole in my stocking. Mrs. Posset is teaching
me to darn, and it is
my duty, but I don't like
my duty. So I was sitting
by the window, and
nobody was doing anything
at all, when suddenly
Vashti Ann fell
right down on the baby's
head and"&mdash;"and
killed her!" cried Fluff,
bursting into tears.
"Killed her all dead into
little pieces!" "How
very, very shocking!" I said. "And was the wretched mother hurt
herself?" "No!" answered Puff. "Her head was china, Mr.
Moonman, and the baby's was wax, you see." "I see!" said I.
"The brass pot and the earthen one!" "If you had ever seen Vashti
Ann, Mr. Moonman," said Fluff through her tears, "you would not
call her such names as a brass pot. Her hair was gossy as the raven's
wing, like the lady in the ballad that Uncle Jack read to us last night;
and I never wanted to call her Vashti Ann, but I wanted to call her
Isidora Vienna, but Uncle Jack said her name was Vashti Ann when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he buyed her, so I couldn't help it." And Fluff dried her eyes with the
end of the pillow-case, and looked very mournful. "Well! well!" I
said. "This is certainly very painful. So then you hanged Vashti
Ann?" "No, Nibble hanged her," said Fluff, "with a clothesline,
and it was a terribul scene, Uncle Jack said it was. And then we
buried them both together under a rose bush. We are going to have
a monument over them, but Nibble wants to put 'the Murdered and
the Murderess' on it, and I won't have it." "I certainly would not!"
said I. "But now you must call Nibble, and Brighteyes too, for the
little Winds are growing impatient, and we must be off. Dry your
eyes, little one, and think what a fine ride you are going to have!"</p>

<p>Nibble and Brighteyes were summoned; and in a few minutes all
the five mice were sitting comfortably in the very softest, fattest,
whitest cloud that the whole sky could produce. How it curled up
round their shoulders, and wrapped itself about them! and how they
did enjoy the luxurious softness! then the seven Winds puffed at it,
and away it went like a ball of thistledown through the air! "Where
shall we go, my pets?" I asked, as I rode along, beside them.
"You have the wide world to choose from, und shall go just where
you please." "I want to go to the North Pole, Mr. Moonman!"
cried Nibble. "You promised us to take us there, you remember,
the last time you came. I want to see the icebergs, and the white
bears, and all the wonderful things there are there!" "To the
North Pole it is, then!" I replied. "It is just the night for it, as all
the savage Winds are away."</p>

<p>So we flew northward, far and far away, over cities and hamlets,
over vast plains and shaggy forests. By the margin of a pond that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
we passed a tall night-heron was standing on one leg. He looked up
at us, and was so much astonished that he toppled over and fell into
the water with a loud splash. How all the mice laughed, and the
merry Winds with them! all, that is, except my little Fluff, who
looked sad, and was still thinking of Vashti Ann. "Fluffy," I said,
"I must see you smile again. Shall I sing you a song that I heard
to-day?" "Yes, if you please, Mr. Moonman!" said Fluff meekly.
"It is a funny little song," I said.
"I heard an Irish mother singing
it to her baby. She was sitting by
the door of her cottage with the
baby in her lap, and she was paring
potatoes, and all the parings fell
into the baby's face, but he did not
seem to mind it at all, so I suppose
it was all right."</p>

And when evening came, there was wather enough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For to fill up the salt, salt say!</span><br />
</div>

<p>Fluff laughed a little; and presently she said shyly, "I can sing a
song too, Mr. Moonman, if you would like to hear it. It is a song
about some dogs, and perhaps if you would learn it, you could sing it
to your dog when you get home." "Let us have the song, by all
means," I said. "My dog is very fond of music, and has himself a
powerful voice."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs078.png" width="450" height="158" alt="Dogs" title="" />

<p>"Bravo! Fluff," I said. "That is a good song, and they were
sensible little dogs. It is well to be sure about understanding a
thing before one attempts it, as Master Nibble would find out, if he
were once mounted on this frisky moonbeam, at which he is casting
such longing eyes." "It does look so delightful!" sighed Nibble.
"But after all, the cloud is delightful too, and I suppose I should be
cold if I were not wrapped up in it. How far north are we now, Mr.
Moonman?" "Somewhere near the coast of Labrador," I replied.
"Little Winds, lower the cloud a bit,
that the mice may see the fishing fleet.
The fishermen are all asleep, but the
boats are a pretty sight, when they can
be seen through the fog."</p>


<p>Lightly and softly the cloud floated
downward, and as they descended, the
merry Winds blew the wreaths of fog
away, so that we could see the bare
brown coast, and the hundreds of fishing-smacks
lying at anchor. Lights gleamed
at bow and stern. They danced about,
as the little vessels rocked gently on the
waves, which seemed to be half asleep, singing soft lullabies to each
other.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "this is a holiday-time for the waves, and still more
for the fish. All day long the poor creatures have a hard time of it,
for hundreds and hundreds of skilful and eager fishermen are on the
look-out for them. But at night their only enemies are those who
live in the water, and I have heard that the whale and the swordfish
go to bed at ten o'clock regularly, and never stir from their trundle-beds
till six o'clock in the morning. I do not state that as a fact,
however, because I am not positively sure about it." "Dear me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
said Brighteyes. "Just fancy a whale in a trundle-bed! how very
queer he would look!" "Does he spout when he's asleep?" inquired
Fluff anxiously. "Because the bedclothes would get wet, you
know, and he would take cold!"</p>

<p>Here, I am sorry to say, the other mice laughed, and Fluffy does not
like to be laughed at, so she was silent. Then said one of the seven
Winds, "I never saw any of them in bed, but I have seen their races,
and very funny they are. They have hurdle-races every Tuesday
afternoon, jumping over the fragments of wrecks which are strewn all
over the bottom of the sea. They lead a merry life, those whales;
what with hurdle-races and fish hunts and spouting matches. If one
could not live in the air, the next best thing would be to live in the
water, I think. Hi! yonder is a fleet of icebergs. Look, little
Heavyones! that is a sight worth seeing."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs081.png" width="450" height="267" alt="Fish and whales" title="" />
</div>

<p>Surely, it was very beautiful, though terrible. My silver beams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
lighted up the huge masses of ice, till they looked like mountains of
crystal, moving slowly over the face of the water. The children
gazed at them, half frightened, half-admiring, and wrapped themselves
more closely in the warm, fleecy cloud. The icebergs formed
a huge circle, and midway in it the cloud floated, rocking like an airy
vessel as the Winds breathed softly on it. We were all silent for a
time: then Brighteyes asked in a half-whisper. "Is this the North
Pole, Mr. Moonman?" "Why, no, Brighteyes!" said Puff. "It
can't be the Pole, for there isn't any pole for it to be!" "Yes," I
said, "that is one way of putting it. We have not reached the North
Pole, my mice, and indeed I think we shall hardly go so far to-night,
for I see that these icebergs are waiting for the North Wind to blow
them home, and that is a sign that he will soon be here. He is a
disagreeable fellow, and might be rude to you, so we will fly over to
Greenland instead, and see some little friends of mine there. Will
that suit you just as well?" "Oh! yes," cried the five voices. "It
will be better, for we want to see what the people are like in these
strange places." So we floated low till we came to a certain small
Esquimaux village on the west of Greenland. "What are all those
queer humps of snow on the ground?" asked Fluff. "Oh!" cried
Nibble, clapping his hands. "<i>I</i> know! they are houses, for I have
seen pictures of them. See! there is smoke coming out of the top
of one. And now somebody is coming out of the doorway. Oh!
it is a bear, Mr. Moonman! do they have tame bears? And he is
brown, and I thought they were all white." "Gently, Nibble!" I
said, "your eyes are very sharp usually, but it is shocking that you
should not know a boy from a bear. That is Nayato, one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
young friends of whom I spoke just now. There comes his brother
Kotchink, and the small figure creeping out of the next house is Polpo,
the friend and playmate of the two other boys. Now they will
have fine sport, for this is their play-time, and they are as fond of
play as any of you." The five mice leaned over the edge of the
cloud as far as they dared, and watched the Esquimaux boys with
breathless interest. They were queer little fellows, clad in furs from
head to foot, and were fat and oily-looking, as indeed anyone might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
be who ate blubber three times a day: but otherwise they were
apparently much like boys all over the world. They chased each
other, and played hide-and-seek behind blocks of ice and snow, and
amused themselves in all kinds of ways. Their only playthings were
some bones of the seal and walrus, nicely polished, but they seemed
to have just as much fun with them as if they had been the finest
marbles or the most superlative tops that the world could produce.
"How jolly they look!" said Nibble. "I wish I could jump down
and play with them! and oh! don't they talk strangely, Brighteyes?
'Wogglety wagglety, chacka-chacka punksky'&mdash;what are they saying,
Mr. Moonman?"
"Nayato is telling Polpo
of the narrow escape
his father had
yesterday," I replied.
"It seems that he was
out on the flat ice
looking out for seals.
He had just harpooned
a fine fellow, and
was just on the point
of putting him on his
sledge, when he heard
a loud snuffling noise
behind him; and turning
round, saw to his
horror a huge white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
bear, squatting on the ice within a few yards of him, and apparently
trying to decide whether the seal or the seal-hunter would make the
more savory meal. Wallop, however, (that is the man's name,) had
no doubt about the matter. He flung the seal towards his Polar
Majesty, and took to his heels, fortunately reaching his reindeer-sledge
in time to escape being made the second course of Bruin's
dinner. 'Chacka-chacka punksky' means 'I will kill that bear
when I am a man.'"</p>

<img src="images/gs083.png" width="286" height="375" alt="Polar bear" title="" />
</div>


<p>"Oh! how exciting that must have been!" cried Nibble. "I
think I should like
to be an Esquimaux,
Mr. Moonman!
Couldn't you leave
me here for a week
or two?" "To live
in a snow hut, and
eat blubber and
drink train-oil?" I
asked in return.
"No, my mouse, I
could not, or at least
I would not. And
that reminds me that
we must be flying
home again, for
morning will soon
be here. Blow, little Winds, blow the cloud back as fast as you can."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>How the seven little fellows puffed out their cheeks, and flapped
their wings! and how the cloud flew through the air! The mice
looked back regretfully, but the Esquimaux boys were already out of
sight. Southward and still southward we flew, the Winds striving
with might and main to keep up with my swift beam. Over land
and sea, mountain and valley, forest and meadow, till at last the
great linden trees around the Mouse-trap were shaking their heads at
us, and the tall chimneys pointed at us, and said, "look at those
children! they have been out all night, which is shocking. That
vagrant Moonman is teaching them the worst possible habits!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>A BIRTHDAY PARTY.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Uncle Jack!</span>" said Fluff, one morning, as she came and stood
by her uncle's side in the porch, while he was reading his newspaper.</p>

<p>"Well, Blossom!" said Uncle Jack, looking up, "what is it? any
more murders in the nursery? we shall have to hang all those dolls
before long, I am firmly convinced of it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs085.png" width="450" height="302" alt="Playing on the floor" title="" />
</div>

<p>"No! no! Uncle Jack," exclaimed Fluff, looking much distressed.
"It is nothing about the dolls; and you <i>know</i> that was a waxidental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
murder, Uncle, and I don't see why you laugh about it." "There!
there! little woman," said the good uncle, taking her on his knee and
kissing her; "she shall not be teased about her children. But now
let me hear quickly what you want to say, Blossom, for I must finish
reading my newspaper."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle," said Fluff, in a confidential tone, "this is Peepsy's
birthday, you know, and I want to make some pottery for him. I
have made a little, but there is something queer about it, and I want
you to help me."</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Uncle Jack, gravely. "Let us understand this
thing thoroughly. Peepsy, you say? Peepsy? I don't seem to
recall the name. Is she a doll?"</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>no!</i> Uncle Jacket!" cried Fluff. "How could she be a
doll when she is a bird? and besides, she isn't she at all; she is he."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/gs086.png" width="293" height="300" alt="Broken pottery" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh!" said Uncle
Jack; "a bird! ah yes!
that alters the case.
And you want to make
some pottery for him,
eh? why, what's the
matter? have you
broken his water-dish,
or his bath-tub?"</p>


<p>Fluffy sighed and
looked despondent.
Then she said very gently,
"Perhaps you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
not quite well this morning, Uncle Jack, for I cannot make you possibly
understand anything. When I say pottery, I mean pottery
with rhymes in it, like the Riginal Poems. Don't you know 'The
Lobster's black, when boiled he's red?' that's what I mean."</p>

<p>"To be sure!" <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suid'">said</ins> Uncle Jack. "I am certainly very stupid
this morning, but now I understand. We are to make some rhymes,
(we call it <i>poetry</i>, Fluffy dear, not pottery,) about Peepsy, a bird,
whose birthday is to be celebrated to-day. And it is to be like
the Original Poems for Infant Minds; and you have made part of it,
and I am to help you with the rest. Is that all right, my Blossom?"</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/gs087.png" width="298" height="300" alt="Sleeping dolly" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, you clever Uncle!" cried Fluff, clapping her hands. "That
is all right, and the paper is all ready in the library, please, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh! you little monkey!" said Uncle Jack, laughing and laying
aside his paper. "Well, the sooner it is done the sooner it is done
with, as Mrs. Posset says. So run along, and I will follow you."</p>


<p>Fluff led the way joyfully
to the library, and
for some time the two
were closeted together, in
deep and earnest consultation.
At length Fluff
came out, looking very
happy and proud, waving
a paper in her hand. She
ran up to the nursery,
where Puff and Downy
were, busy with the doll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
family, the remaining members of which were more tenderly
cherished than ever, since the deaths of Vashti Ann and her daughter.
Fluff entered in triumph with her paper. "Here is the pottery,
Puffy!" she said. "Uncle Jack says it isn't pottery, but something
else; but here it is, anyhow."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/gs088.png" width="372" height="500" alt="THE DOLL&#39;S NURSERY." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE DOLL&#39;S NURSERY.</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh! how nice!" said Puff. "Sit down and read it to the
children and Peepsy, won't you, Fluff?"</p>

<p>So Fluff sat down, and as soon as she had recovered her breath,
read as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Our Puffy has a little bird,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Peepsy is his name,</span><br />
And now I'll sing a little song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To celebrate the same.</span><br />
<br />
He's yellow all from head to foot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he is very sweet,</span><br />
And very little trouble, for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never wants to eat.</span><br />
<br />
He never asks for water clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never chirps for seed,</span><br />
For cracker or for cuttlefish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For sugar or chickweed.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh what a perfect pet!" you cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But there's one little thing,</span><br />
One drawback to the bonny bird,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our Peepsy cannot sing.</span><br />
<br />
He chirps no song at dawn or eve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He makes no merry din,</span><br />
But this, one cannot wonder at,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Peepsy's made of tin.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/gs089a.png" width="331" height="300" alt="Bird" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Isn't it lovely?" said Puff, drawing a long breath. "It prescribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
him perfectly. Doesn't it, you dear Peepsy?" she added,
holding up a blue cage about
two inches square, in which
hung the precious bird. "And
did you make it almost all,
Fluffy?"</p>


<p>"Well&mdash;no!" said Fluff,
considering, "not almost <i>all</i>,
but almost a good deal of it.
I said all the things I wanted
to say, and Uncle Jack
changed some of the words, and put rhymes into them. I think it
<i>is</i> nice," she continued, "and I am glad you like it, Puff. But now
we must make haste and dress all the dolls in their best clothes, for
Nibble and Brighteyes promised to give Peepsy a birthday party,
you know, and they are
getting it ready in the
garden, under the cotton-wool
tree."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/gs089b.png" width="316" height="325" alt="Gathering" title="" />

</div>

<p>"The cotton-wool
tree!" said I to myself.
"I think I must look and
see what that means."
So I tipped my glass
just a hair's breadth,
towards the lower part of
the garden. There, sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
enough, were Nibble and Brighteyes, hard at work amid the new-mown
hay. They were making it into five hay-cocks, which were
arranged in a circle under a huge balm-of-Gilead tree. The ground
was covered with the pods which had fallen from the tree, all filled
with white soft silk cotton, and I knew this must be the cotton-wool
tree. Grim was tied to
another tree hard by, a
position which he did not
enjoy, to judge from his
impatient jumping and
barking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/gs090.png" width="325" height="210" alt="Grim tied to a tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, Grim, I know it
isn't at all nice to be tied
up!" said Nibble, in reply to a long howl of protest from the dog.
"But we cannot have you jumping over our thrones. When the
party is all ready, you shall come to it, so you ought to be patient.
Now, Brighteyes, if you will make a little cotton-wool throne in the
middle for Peepsy. I will get the lunch ready. Where are the three
bones for the dogs?"</p>

<p>"Over there, behind Fluff's hay-cock," said Brighteyes. "And
there are five gingerbread birds that Susan made, one for each of
us, and the wooden turkey out of the doll-house for Peepsy, because
he won't really eat it, you know. Oh! and we ought to have something
for Tomty, Nibble, for we invited him, and he said he would
certainly come. You might ask Susan for a cup of tea when you go
up to call the children, for I heard Tomty tell her yesterday that all
the vegetables he wanted were bread and tea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, so I will!" said Nibble. "And if Susan will not give us
any, he can have a cup of milk, and play it is tea."</p>

<p>So away went Nibble, jumping on the hay-cocks, and whistling as
he went. Soon he returned, with the three little mice trotting behind
him, and Tomty, with his rake over his shoulder, bringing up the
rear.</p>

<p>"Here we all are!" cried Puff, joyfully. "Is the party ready,
Brighteyes? I think Peepsy is very impatient, though he behaves
beautifully."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/gs091.png" width="378" height="300" alt="Waiting for the party" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, everything is ready!" replied Brighteyes. "Here is
Peepsy's throne in the
middle, and these
hay-cocks are ours.
Put him on his throne,
Puffy&mdash;so! now all
sit down yourselves,
please, and take the
dolls in your laps."
The mice and Tomty
obeyed meekly, and
perched themselves
on the hay-cocks as best they might.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Brighteyes, "we must all have names, of course,
because it isn't any fun just to be ourselves at a party. I will be the
Countess Kinchinjunga. What will you be, Nibble!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I am the Bold Baron of Borodino," said Nibble. "Puff
and Fluff can be the Princess Perriwinkle and the Marchioness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Mulligatawney, and Downy shall be Nosolio, the Niggardly Knife-Grinder
of Nineveh. There's a fine name for you, Downy, boy!"</p>

<p>The Niggardly Knife-Grinder smiled contentedly, and said, "Yef,
I'm dat, only I tan't say it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/gs092.png" width="419" height="325" alt="On a pillow" title="" />
</div>

<p>"And now," said Nibble, "we will have the lunch, and then we
must all make speeches to Peepsy, because that is the proper thing.
Countess Kinchinjunga, produce the feast!" Nibble said this with
a very lordly air, and waved his hand with great dignity; but unfortunately
at that moment he lost his balance, and rolled off the hay-cock,
to the great amusement of the other mice. But Brighteyes
uttered a cry of distress. "Oh! Nibble, you have rolled on Tomty's
cup of tea and upset it. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Miss!" said Tomty, smiling, "sure I'm not hungry,
Miss, let alone it's almost dinner time. And thank ye kindly all the
same, Miss
Brighteyes."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/gs093.png" width="246" height="400" alt="Tomty" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well,
Tomty, you
shall hear the
speeches,
anyhow," said
Nibble, consolingly,
"and
that will be
the best part
of it; though
I am very sorry I upset the tea," he added, "and you shall have my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gingerbread bird, if you like, instead." But Tomty declined the
bird, with many thanks; and now the "party" began in earnest.
Grim was untied, and a sharp whistle from Tomty brought Gruff and
Grab to see what was going on. Each dog received a huge bone as
his share of the feast, and each showed his delight in his own way.
Then the five gingerbread birds were distributed, and the wooden
turkey, which was certainly a work of art, was placed before Peepsy's
cage with a great deal of
ceremony. Peepsy himself
manifested no excitement,
but no doubt he
enjoyed himself in his
own way. Then the turkey
was handed round to
all the dolls, Fanny Elssler
and Katinka and
Sally Bradford; and Puff
declared that they all had
as much as they could
possibly eat, which was
probably true. When the
feast was over, Nibble
rose and said, solemnly,
"the speeches will now
begin. Tomty, you are
the oldest, and you shall
make the first speech to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Peepsy." "Is it the little tin fowl in the cage, sir?" asked Tomty.
"Well, Mr. Peepsy, I've lived forty years, men and boy, and never
made a speech yet, sir, but here's wishing you good health, and long
life to you, Mr. Peepsy; and if you live till you sing a song, you'll
come to a good old age, I'm thinking." And Tomty sat down, amid
the applause of his audience.</p>

<p>"That was a very good speech, Tomty," said Nibble, with a patronizing
air, "though it was short. Now hear mine, all of you. Ahem!"
and the young orator, standing on the top of his hay-cock, struck an
imposing attitude. "Friends, Romans, and Tomty, lend me your
ears! this is Peepsy's birthday, and he is one year old. I bought
him myself at Jane Evans's shop, so I ought to know. He will
never be one year old again, and neither shall we, which makes us all
sad." "I isn't fad a bit!" interrupted Downy, with a gleeful
chuckle. "Well, you ought to be!" said Nibble, "but you are too
young to know much, I suppose. Peepsy is sad, and he might weep
if he had any eyes, but they are only little holes in his head. It is
sad not to have any eyes, but it is an advantage not to be able to
weep. If Puff hadn't had any eyes, she wouldn't have made such a
fuss yesterday when I jumped on her toe from the apple tree, because
I didn't mean to." "I don't think that is very nice to put in a
speech, Nibble!" said Puff, looking rather hurt. "Well," said Nibble,
hastily, "I won't say anything more about it, but I want to say
this:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"When I bought him at Jane Evans's shop,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Peepsy was glad.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now that he is one year old and knows that he won't be it any more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Peepsy is sad."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></div>

<p>"That is poetry," he added, "and that is the best way to finish a
speech."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/gs094.png" width="350" height="339" alt="Bird in a tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>Upon this Nibble sat down, and after a moment's pause, Brighteyes
rose, and spoke as follows: "Peepsy, I am afraid you think it is
very hard that you have to stay in your cage all the time. I know I
should not like to live
in a cage, but then I
am not afraid of cats.
But if you were to
come out and be alive,
you would be dreadfully
afraid of the china
cat in the doll-house,
you know you would.
Thus we see that all
things are for the best!
and I am sure your
cage is a perfect beauty,
which must be a great comfort. Perhaps you think you would like
some worms, Peepsy; and we would certainly get you some if you
could eat them, but you cannot. My dear Peepsy, I will now conclude
my speech, wishing you many happy returns of the day."</p>

<p>Now it was Puff's turn, but to my surprise, this little mouse, who
is generally very ready with her tongue, seemed to hang back. "Let
Fluffy read the pottery!" said Puff. "I am so hot, and my head
aches so, I don't think I can make my speech."</p>

<p>So Fluff read the famous piece of pottery, to the great delight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
all. Meanwhile I was looking more closely at Puff, and though I
was&mdash;well, how many miles off? answer, some of you big children!
certainly a great many!&mdash;still I could see plainly enough that the
child was not well. Her
cheeks were hot and
flushed, and her blue
eyes shone with a strange
brightness, very different
from their usual sunny
light. I was glad to see
that Tomty was also observing
his little pet; and
presently he said quietly,
"Miss Puff, dear, the sun is too hot for you. Shall Tomty give you
a ride on his shoulder, and we'll find Mrs. Posset?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/gs095.png" width="330" height="251" alt="Child not well" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, please, Tomty!" said Puff, wearily; "I am so <i>very</i> tired,
though I don't know why I should be."</p>

<p>The other mice clustered round their sister, and kissed and patted
her. They saw that Tomty looked anxious, and when he had carried
Puff up to the house in his arms, they soon followed, taking Peepsy
and the dolls with them. The three dogs only remained under the
cotton-wool tree, discussing the party very gravely, and wondering
why it was that human beings never cared to gnaw bones. And so,
rather sadly, ended Peepsy's birthday party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>SICKNESS IN THE MOUSE-TRAP.</h3>


<p>I was very anxious about my little Puff, though I had so much to
attend to during the rest of that afternoon, that I could not even
look in my glass to see how things were going at the Mouse-trap.
A young and giddy Comet had got his tail twisted round one of my
mountain-peaks, and could not disentangle it, and this was a pretty
piece of work, as you may imagine. He wriggled and flounced
about in a truly disgraceful manner, and it was only by making
Bmfkgth bite his nose <i>very</i> hard indeed that I was enabled to get
him free, and send him off to his grandmother with a good scolding.
(A comet cannot move his tail when his nose is bitten. This is a
fact not generally known on the earth.) But late in the evening,
when I knew it was sleepy-time for all the little people down below,
I mounted my faithful Flash, and flew down to see how my mice in
general, and my Puffy mouse in particular, were doing.</p>

<p>I found the aspect of the nursery somewhat changed. Downy's
crib was gone, and Puff was alone in the large bed. Uncle Jack was
leaning over her, listening to her heavy breathing, and beside the
bed sat Mrs. Posset, in a huge wrapper and a night-cap, evidently
prepared to sit up all night. As I came in, Uncle Jack was just saying
"The doctor says it is certainly scarlet fever, Mrs. Posset, so I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
shall send the other children off by the early train, to their aunt, who
is at the sea-shore."</p>

<p>"Dear to goodness, sir!" cried Mrs. Posset. "And who is to go
with the lambs? and Downy never away from me a night since he
was born, that is to say, further than the next room!"</p>

<p>"I shall go with them, of course," said Uncle Jack, "and I shall
take Susan as nursery-maid, that they may not give Mrs. Wilton too
much trouble. You will have time to pack their things in the morning,
Mrs. Posset. I must go now to give John and Thomas their
orders, and you are to call me if Puffy wakes, remember!"</p>

<p>Then Uncle Jack went out softly, and Mrs. Posset, after settling
herself comfortably among her cushions, put on her spectacles, and
opening a huge Bible which lay in her lap, began to read. Now was
my chance, for the good nurse was far too wide awake to hear anything
I said, and Puff was in a heavy, feverish sleep.</p>

<p>"So, now we are going to have some delightful evenings together,"
I said, as I sat down by her pillow. "You have the
scarlet fever, my mouse, and all the other mice are to be sent away
to the sea-shore, it seems."</p>

<p>"Are they?" said Puff. "I am glad of that, for then they will
not be ill. But it will be very lonely without them, Mr. Moonman.
And shall I feel so sick all the time, I wonder?"</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/gs097.png" width="339" height="425" alt="Sick in bed wiith dolly" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I hope not, indeed!" I replied; "and as for loneliness, not a
bit of it. In the day time you will have Mrs. Posset and Uncle Jack
to take care of you and pet you, and at night you will have me, and
the dolls beside. I see that you have Sally Bradford here beside
you. You will find her quite companionable, I assure you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the dolls cannot talk, Mr. Moonman!" said Puff. "I have
often and often tried to make them, but they never say a word."</p>


<p>"That is because you only try in the day time, Miss Puff!" said
Sally Bradford, in a shrill voice. "No well-bred doll would ever
think of talking in the day time, as Mr. Moonman can tell you.
Try us at night, when you are asleep, and you will find that we have
quite as much to say for ourselves as other people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it seems so queer to be doing things when one is asleep!"
said Puff.</p>

<p>"Why queerer than to do them when one is awake?" I asked.
"The dolls wonder at you quite as much as you wonder at
them, depend upon it! And now, what shall I do to amuse you,
mouse of mine? will you have a story, or a song, or what will you
have?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will have both, if I may, Mr. Moonman!" answered
Puff. "I should like to hear stories and songs every days and all
nights, and never stop!"</p>

<p>So I sang, and all the dolls sat up in their beds to listen. The
Jumping-Jack held up his hands with delight, and the wooden Nutcracker
grinned from ear to ear. Only Mrs. Posset sat up in the big
chair, wide awake, and heard never a word.</p>

<h3>THE FAIRY TEA-PARTY.</h3>

<div class='poem2'>
I went to take tea with the three little <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'faries'">fairies</ins><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who live in the depth of the hazel wood.</span><br />
And what do you think we had for supper?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh! everything dainty and everything good.</span><br />
<br />
There was tea in a buttercup, cream in a blue-bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marigold butter and hollyhock cheese,</span><br />
Slices of strawberry served in a nutshell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And honey just brought by the liveried bees.</span><br />
<br />
We sat 'neath the shade of a silvery mushroom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All lined with pale pink, nicely fluted and quilled,</span><br />
And around us the cup-moss held up its red goblets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each one with a dew drop like diamond filled.</span><br />
<br />
We ate and we drank and we chatted together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the fireflies lighted us off to our beds;</span><br />
And we all fell asleep in our cots made of rose leaves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pillows of thistledown under our heads.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"How nice that must have been!" sighed Puffy. "I wish I
could see all the lovely things you see, Mr. Moonman! Don't you
want Fluffy and me to come up and be your little girls in the Moon?
then we could see all the wonderful things for ourselves."</p>

<p>"And I should not have the pleasure of telling you about them,"
I replied, "which would be truly melancholy. No, no, my little one!
you are far better off where you are. But now we are to have a
story, and what shall it be about?"</p>

<p>"Tell her about the poor little woodmouse, Master!" said Flash,
who had been staring at Sally Bradford with all his might for ten
minutes, in the vain hope of making her wink. "The little woodmouse?"
I said. "To be sure! you mean the one that Twinkle
saw in the forest the other night. It is rather a sad story, but Puffy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
shall hear it. It seems, Puffy, that Twinkle, who, as you know, is
one of Flash's brothers, was in the oak wood one night last week,
wandering about as is his wont, chatting with such flowers as were
still awake, and seeing all that he could see. As he twinkled over
the grass near the foot of a great oak tree, he noticed something
moving, and stopped to see what it was. The something turned out
to be a woodmouse, the prettiest little lady woodmouse that ever was
seen. She was sitting under a huge yellow toadstool, (very different
from the pink-lined mushroom which sheltered the three little fairies,)
feasting on acorns to her heart's content. Twinkle said it was really
astonishing to see how fast she cracked and ate them, throwing the
shells to right and left, and glancing about with her sharp black
eyes, in constant fear of some intruder. Presently she heard a
rustling among the leaves, and, anxious to make sure of her supper,
she hastily put two acorns into her mouth, cramming one into either
cheek. Then she sat up, and tried to look very dignified, as another
little woodmouse, as sleek and bright-eyed as herself, appeared upon
the scene. He evidently knew the little lady, for when he saw her
he stopped and made a low bow, pressing one paw on his heart in a
most affecting manner. Then advancing toward her, he said softly,
'Miss Woodmouse. I have been searching for you all the evening,
for I have been very anxious to see you. I trust that my presence is
not disagreeable to you, Miss Woodmouse?' He paused for a
reply, but none came, so he went on. 'Lovely creature, I have long
admired you, and thought you the fairest mouse I ever gazed upon.
The brightness of your eyes, the length of your tail, the sharpness
of your whiskers, all proclaim you the belle of the forest. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
happy should I be, if I could claim these charms for my own! I
have a very snug nest, lined with moss, and well stored with nuts
and acorns for the winter. Say, will you share that nest with me?
Miss Woodmouse, will you be mine? answer me, I implore you!'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/gs099.png" width="394" height="500" alt="MISS WOODMOUSE." title="" />
<span class="caption">MISS WOODMOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>"Poor little Miss Woodmouse! it was really pitiful to see her distress.
She could not speak, on account of the two acorns in her
mouth; and she was so ashamed of being greedy, that she did not
dare to take them out. So she just sat still and looked at the little
gentleman, who in turn sat and looked at her, much amazed at her
silence.</p>

<p>"'Alas!' he said, 'am I so hateful to you that you will not even
speak to me? One word, Miss Woodmouse, to say that I may hope!'
But not one word could Miss Woodmouse say, though her long tail
quivered with emotion; and at length her little lover, fairly discouraged,
turned sadly away, and disappeared among the fallen
leaves.</p>

<p>"Then little Miss Woodmouse took the two acorns out of her
mouth, and looked at them; but her appetite was gone. She threw
them away with an exclamation of sorrow, and putting her little pink
pocket-handkerchief up to her little black eyes, she hurried off to
her lonely nest."</p>

<p>"Now that is the whole story, and the moral of it is that we should
not be greedy. Lay it to heart, my Puff, and do not insist upon
drinking the whole of that medicine that Mrs. Posset is preparing
for you. You will have to wake up and take it now, Mousekin, so
good-bye for the present!"</p>

<p>Puffy smiled a good-bye, and opened her sweet eyes with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
smile still on her face. I looked back as I stepped out of the window,
and will do her the justice to say that she showed no disposition
to be greedy as far as the medicine was concerned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>OFF TO THE SEA-SHORE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Uncle
Jack</span> was as
good as his
word, and the
next morning
was a busy
time at the
Mouse-trap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs101.png" width="500" height="373" alt="The Mice" title="" />
</div>

<p>Trunks were packed, jackets were
brushed, and wonders were accomplished
in the way of getting ready before breakfast.
As I looked in my glass, there seemed to be only two rooms
in the house where there was no bustle and confusion: one was the
nursery, where Puff lay, half-awake and wondering what all the noise
was about; and the other was the room next to it, where my dear
little Fluff was kneeling by the bed, praying that her darling sister
might be "quite all perfectly well" very soon.</p>

<p>And now the carriage was announced; the "good-byes" were
softly whispered at the nursery door, and away went four of my mice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
leaving the poor old Mouse-trap quite deserted, with only Mrs. Posset
and the cook and faithful Tomty, beside the poor little sick
mouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs102.png" width="450" height="312" alt="Saying prayers" title="" />
</div>

<p>A few hours journey on the train brought the travelers to the
lovely sea-shore place where Aunt Grace Wilton was spending the
summer: and what was their delight on leaving the train, to find
Aunt Grace herself waiting for them, with her basket-wagon, and
Max, the pretty black pony. I know Mrs. Wilton, though she does
not remember me. I used to pay her frequent visits when she was a
child, and now I go to see Roger, her little boy, who is a great friend
of mine, and a fine little fellow. He had the scarlet fever when he
was two years old, so that his mother had no fear of his taking it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
again. Well how all those mice managed to get into that pony-carriage
is more than I can tell you: but they did manage it somehow,
and after bidding good-bye to their dear Uncle Jack, who was
going back in the next train, as he did not like to stay away from
Puff, they rolled away at a fine pace toward Glenwood, while Susan
followed in the carts with the trunks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs103.png" width="450" height="296" alt="In a carriage" title="" />
</div>

<p>A very pretty place Glenwood is, and very much delighted the
four mice were, when they tumbled out of the carriage, and saw
Roger waiting to welcome them. Here I will make a little picture
of Roger, by the way, as of course a great many of you have never
seen him.</p>

<p>"How do, Nibble?" he cried, jumping up and down with joy as
he saw his cousins. "How do, all of you! come and see my pets!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
I-have-a-cat-and-some-birds-and-a-rabbit-and-a-lamb-because-I-haven't-any-brothers-and-sisters-you-know-and-a-dog&mdash;big-enough&mdash;to-eat-them-all-up-and-do-you-think-Puff-would-like-a-white-kitten?"</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/gs104.png" width="173" height="250" alt="Little boy" title="" />
</div>

<p>Roger said all this as if it were one
word, and it was no wonder that the four
mice looked rather bewildered.</p>

<p>"Gently, Roger! gently!" said his
mother, laughing. "Your cousins cannot
understand a word you say, if you talk so
fast."</p>

<p>"I heard 'lamb' and 'kitten,' Auntie,"
said Fluff, sedately, "and I should like to
see them very much indeed."</p>


<p>"I want to go down to the beach, please, Auntie!" cried Nibble.</p>

<p>"And so do I!" said Brighteyes, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Very well, dears," said Mrs. Wilton; "you may run wherever
you like, if you are not tired. I shall take little Downy in the house
with me, for I see he is very sleepy, and wants a nap. But, my
chickens, don't you want some lunch before you go out to play?"
she added, turning back from the door.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, Auntie!" they all cried. "We had lunch in the train,
as much as we wanted."</p>

<p>And off they all scampered in different directions, while Mrs. Wilton
went into the house, carrying little sleepy Downy in her arms.
Fluff and Roger walked away hand in hand, and I tipped my glass
so that I could follow.</p>

<p>"Have you many pets, Fluff?" asked Roger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" replied Fluff. "We have only the three dogs, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jose'">Jos&eacute;</ins>,
the brown donkey, and the kitten that Brighteyes found in the tree.
But then we have a great many dolls," she added, "and I suppose
you have'nt any dolls, because you are a boy."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs105.png" width="450" height="273" alt="Fluff and Roger" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Animals is better than dolls," said Roger. "Here is my lamb,
under this tree. Isn't he lovely? here, Belladonna, come and have
some sugar, dear!" The lamb, which was a very pretty one, came
up to be petted, and ate a lump of sugar with every sign of
approval.</p>

<p>"What did you say his name was?" asked Fluff.</p>

<p>"Belladonna," replied Roger, "because he wears a bell, you
know. <i>I</i> think it is a very pretty name, but Mamma laughs at it."</p>

<p>"It's medicine, isn't it?" said Fluff, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, yes!" said Roger; "but that doesn't make any difference.
Rhubarb is medicine, too, and yet it makes nice pies and tarts."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs106.png" width="400" height="278" alt="Playing with a lamb" title="" />
</div>

<p>"So it does!" said Fluff; "I never thought of that. And have
your other
pets, medicine-names,
too, Roger?"</p>

<p>"The dog
is Blanco,"
replied
Roger. "I
called him
that before I
had him, because
I thought he was going to be white, and Blanco means
white. And then he went and was black when he came, but I don't
like to change names, so I called him so just the same. And I call
my cat Plunket, after the story of the Chattering Cat, and the rabbit
is Binks, and&mdash;oh! well, let us go in and see them, for they are all
in the play-room, and it is hot out here!"</p>


<p>And Roger led the way to the house, while Fluff followed meekly,
wondering, as she said afterwards to Brighteyes, how any one could
talk so fast without "getting his tongue all tied up with his teeth."</p>

<p>In the large, sunny play-room I left the two little ones, having a
grand game of romps with Blanco and Binks, while the birds, let
loose from their cage, fluttered about their heads, in no fear of the
well-behaved cat, who sat and looked at them as if she had no idea
that they were good to eat. Yes it was a regular Happy Family, and
a very pretty sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs107.png" width="450" height="373" alt="Playing with the dog, the cat and a bunny" title="" />
</div>

<p>But I wanted to see what Nibble and Brighteyes were about, so I
turned my glass towards the beach, which was not far from the house,
though in the other direction. There I found my two eldest mice
deep in consultation. Nibble was just saying, "but, Bright, mermaids
don't have legs and tails, too, for that would be ridiculous.
Don't you remember?</p>

<div class='poem'>
'The little white mermaidens live in the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a palace of silver and gold.</span><br />
And their neat little tails are all covered with scales,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most beautiful for to behold.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But it doesn't say anything about legs, and there aren't any in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pictures." "I can't help it, Nibble!" replied Brighteyes, rather
pettishly. "I can't cut off my legs, and I <i>am</i> going to play mermaid.
I can be the queen, and queens have everything they want, I
know." And she turned round, displaying to my view a superb tail
of seaweed, fastened to her sash, and trailing upon the ground.</div>

<p>"Well," said Nibble, "it is a lovely tail, after all. But we must
take off our shoes and stockings, and put them in the fort for safe
keeping. Then we can play 'wild white horses' and 'mermaid'
too."</p>

<p>The shoes and stockings were soon off, and safely hidden in a sand
fort of very superior construction. Then began a wild rushing up
and down the smooth sandy beach, with much neighing and kicking
on Nibble's part, while Brighteyes waved her seaweed tail in a graceful
and effective manner, and sang her song of the mermaids.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"On wild white horses they ride, they ride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in chairs of pink coral they sit,</span><br />
They swim all the night, with a smile of delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never feel tired a bit."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Look!" said Nibble, "at that line of rocks running out into the
water. What fun to jump from one to the other! come on, Brighteyes!"
No sooner said than done. It was no easy matter to jump
from one smooth slippery rock to the next, without losing foothold,
but that made it all the more exciting.</p>

<p>"I am the Nixie!" said Brighteyes, "and you are the knight who
caught her asleep and cut off one of her golden ringlets, so that she
could not disappear or turn into a fish. Sing, now, and catch me if
you can!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/gs108.png" width="366" height="500" alt="ON THE BEACH." title="" />
<span class="caption">ON THE BEACH.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>She sprang lightly to the next rock, and thence to the next, while
Nibble, pursuing her, sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Nixie, white Nixie, I have you now!<br />
The magic ringlet is clipped from your brow.<br />
You vanish no more 'neath the shining tide,<br />
And I have you and hold you, my snow-white bride!"<br />
</div>

<p>Brighteyes sang again:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Hunter, rash hunter, your triumph's not long,<br />
Your arm drops down 'neath the spell of my song.<br />
You turn to ice and you turn to stone,<br />
And the sea-waves laugh as they hear you moan."<br />
</div>

<p>Here the Nixie waved her tail triumphantly, and flirted it in the
hunter's face in a way that was too provoking to be endured. The
rash youth sprang forward, alighting on the rock and on the Nixie's
toe at the same instant. There was a moment of shrieking and
clutching at the air, as they tried to regain their balance, and then
with a loud splash, pursuer and pursued disappeared beneath the
water.</p>

<p>This was really past a joke, and I became much alarmed. As for
Bmfkgth, that excellent dog was quite frantic with excitement, and
his green hair stood on end, causing him to present a truly remarkable
appearance. In another minute, however, we saw the two
brown heads emerge from the water; Nibble clambered up the rock,
and pulled his sister up after him; then breathless and dripping,
they jumped and climbed back over the long line of rocks, till they
reached the shore. They sat down on the beach and looked at each
other in silence for a few minutes. Then Nibble said, "I say,
Brighteyes, ain't you just glad that Mrs. Posset isn't here? look at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
your frock, now!" "Oh! I don't want to look at it!" said Brighteyes;
"and besides your knickerbockers are just as bad. But we
have lost our hats, Nibble, and they were our best ones. We ought
to have taken them off when we took off our shoes and&mdash;but,
goodness me! where <i>are</i> our shoes and stockings? Nibble, where
is the fort? I don't see it anywhere."</p>

<p>Indeed, it would have been strange if they had seen it, for the
rising tide had completely covered it some fifteen minutes before.
As for the shoes and stockings&mdash;"Look, Bright!" said Nibble,
grasping his sister's arm, and pointing to the water. Yes, sure
enough, there they were. Far out of reach, floating serenely along,
the boots nodding a graceful farewell to their former owners as the
little waves bore them off on their voyage of discovery, while the
stockings, less courageous, had yielded to despair, and floated limp
and piteous, stretching out their scarlet length in a vain appeal for
rescue.</p>

<p>This last blow completely sobered the bold spirits of my two mice,
and as the loud ringing of a bell proclaimed that dinner-time was
come, they turned silently and mournfully towards the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<h3>STORIES AGAIN.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/gs110.png" width="330" height="350" alt="Rocking dolly" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> little Puff! she certainly
was very ill. All day
long she tossed and moaned in
feverish pain, to the great distress
of her good uncle, and
the faithful Mrs. Posset. They
were very, very anxious about
her; but the doctor, who came
every day, said that there was
no immediate danger, as long
as the child slept so well at
night. All night long she slept quietly, sometimes smiling in her
sleep, and always looking peaceful and happy. Yes, indeed, I flatter
myself I had a great deal to do with that. Every night I sat by my
little mouse's pillow, and told stories and sang songs, till my brother
Sun came and winked at me through the window, and told me it was
not night at all, and I must take myself off and leave the field to
him. Stories? dear me, there was no end to them; and you shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
have some of them, if you will. Here is one, for example, of which
Puff was extremely fond. It was called</p>


<h4>THE FLEA.</h4>

<div class='poem'>
Once upon a time there was a flea.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wee wee.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he hopped,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And he hopped,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">And he hopped.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And as the flea was hopping one day,</p>

<div class='poem'>
He met a mouse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round the house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he squeaked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And he squeaked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">And he squeaked.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And when the mouse saw the flea, he said to him, "what do you
do for a living?" and the flea said "I bite people." Then the
mouse said, "as you have lived upon others, others shall live upon
you!" So he caught up the flea, and he ate him up. And there
was an end of the flea.</p>

<p>But as the mouse was squeaking one day,</p>

<div class='poem'>
He met a cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Very fat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she mewed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And she mewed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">And she mewed.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And when the cat saw the mouse, she said to him, "what do you
do for a living?" And the mouse said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I nibble cheese,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And eat fleas."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then the cat said, "As you have lived upon others, others shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
live upon you!" So she caught the mouse, and she ate him up.
And there was an end of the mouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs111.png" width="450" height="319" alt="Cat in a boot" title="" />
</div>

<p>But as the cat was mewing one day,</p>

<div class='poem'>
She met a dog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Named Gog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he barked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And he barked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">And he barked.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And when the dog saw the cat, he said to her, "what do you do
for a living?" And the cat said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I eat mice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Because they are nice."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then the dog said, "As you have lived upon others, others shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
live upon you!" So he caught the cat, and he ate her up. And
there was an end of the cat.</p>

<p>But as the dog was barking one day,</p>

<div class='poem'>
He met a Chinaman,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ting-Pan.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he talked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And he talked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">And he talked.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And when the Chinaman saw the dog, he said to him, "what do
you do for a living?" And the dog said, "I slay the cat, and likewise
the rat." Then the Chinaman said, "as you have lived upon
others, others shall live upon you!" So he caught the dog, and he
cooked him with rice, and ate him up. And there was an end of the
dog.</p>

<p>But now, you see, the Chinaman had eaten</p>

<div class='poem'>
The dog,<br />
Named Gog,<br />
And the cat,<br />
Very fat,<br />
And the mouse,<br />
Round the house,<br />
And the flea,<br />
Wee wee.<br />
</div>

<p>So when he had eaten them all, they all disagreed with him, and
he died. And there was an end of the Chinaman, Ting-Pan.</p>

<p>This was Puff's favorite story, and I had to tell it at least once
every night, and often twice. Then when that was done, she would
call for "Michikee Moo." You have never heard that, I'll warrant,
for you do not, most of you, understand the Pawnee dialect, and
"Michikee Moo" is a Pawnee ballad. The Indian mammas sing it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to their pappooses, as they rock them in their bark cradles under
the trees, in the western forests. I had to translate it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'in into'">into</ins> English,
of course, for Puff; so here it is.</p>


<div class='center'>MICHIKEE MOO.</div>

<div class='center'><small>AN INDIAN BALLAD.</small></div>

<div class='poem'>
Whopsy Whittlesy Whanko Whee,<br />
Howly old growly old Indian he,<br />
Lived on the hill of the Mungo-Paws,<br />
With all his pappooses and all his squaws.<br />
There was Wah-wah-bocky, the Blue-nosed Goose,<br />
And Ching-gach-gocky, the Capering-Moose;<br />
There was Peeksy Wiggin, and Squawpan too,<br />
But the fairest of all was Michikee Moo.<br />
Michikee Moo, the Savoury Tart,<br />
Pride of Whittlesy Whanko's heart.<br />
Michikee Moo, the Cherokee Pie,<br />
Apple of Whittlesy Whanko's eye.<br />
<br />
Whittlesy Whanko loved her so<br />
That the other squaws did with envy glow.<br />
And each said to the other "Now what shall we do<br />
To spoil the beauty of Michikee Moo?"<br />
"We'll lure her away to the mountain top,<br />
And there her head we will neatly chop!"<br />
"We'll wile her away to the forest's heart,<br />
And shoot her down with a poisoned dart!"<br />
"We'll 'tice her away to the river side,<br />
And there she shall be the Manitou's bride!"<br />
"Oh! one of these things we will surely do,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>And we'll spoil the beauty of Michikee Moo!"<br />
<br />
"Michikee Moo, thou Cherokee Pie,<br />
Away with me to the mountain high!"<br />
"Nay, my sister, I will not roam;<br />
I'm safer and happier here at home,"<br />
"Michikee Moo, thou Savoury Tart,<br />
Away with me to the forest's heart!"<br />
"Nay, my sister, I will not go;<br />
I fear the dart of some hidden foe."<br />
"Michikee Moo, old Whittlesy's pride,<br />
Away with me to the river-side!"<br />
"Nay, my sister, for fear I fall.<br />
And wouldst thou come if thou heardst me call?"<br />
"Now choose thee, choose thee thy way of death,<br />
For soon thou shalt draw thy latest breath.<br />
We all have sworn that to-day we'll see<br />
The last, fair Michikee Moo, of thee!"<br />
<br />
Whittlesy Whanko, hidden near,<br />
Each and all of these words did hear.<br />
He summoned his braves, all painted for war,<br />
And gave them in charge each guilty squaw.<br />
"Take Wah-wah-bocky, the Blue-nosed Goose!<br />
Take Ching-gach-gocky, the Capering Moose!<br />
Take Peeksy Wiggin, and Squawpan too,<br />
And leave me alone with my Michikee Moo!<br />
This one away to the mountain-top,<br />
And there her head ye shall neatly chop.<br />
This one away to the forest's heart,<br />
And shoot her down with a poisoned dart.<br />
This one away to the river-side,<br />
And there let her be the Manitou's bride.<br />
Away with them all, the woodlands through.<br />
For I'll have no squaw save Michikee Moo!"<br />
Away went the braves, without question or pause,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>And they soon put an end to the guilty squaws;<br />
They pleasantly smiled when the deed was done,<br />
Saying "Ping-ko-chanky! oh! isn't it fun?"<br />
And then they all danced the Buffalo dance,<br />
And capered about with ambiguous prance;<br />
While they drank to the health of the lovers so true,<br />
Brave Whittlesy Whanko and Michikee Moo.<br />
</div>

<p>"I wish I had an Indian doll, Mr. Moonman!" said Fluff one
night, after I had sung this ballad to her. "A little pappoose! it
would be so nice!"</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier!" I replied. "Take Katinka, there, who has
long black hair; stain her face and neck with walnut juice, and paint
her with stripes and spots of red and yellow. Then wrap her up in
a blanket and put some beads round her neck, and you have an
Indian doll. She will be a truly lovely object, according to Indian
ideas, which indeed may not be quite the same as your own, but
what of that?"</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Mr. Moonman!" said Katinka, who was
spending the night on Puff's bed. "I am very sure my dear little
mother will do nothing of the kind. Walnut juice, indeed! and for
me, who have the finest complexion in the doll-house! You might
take Sally Bradford, now, and she would not look more like a witch
than she does now; but I am a French doll, and am not used to
such treatment."</p>

<p>"Don't abuse Sally Bradford, Miss!" I said. "She is an excellent
doll, for whom I have a great respect; and as for your fine
complexion, why, we all know that 'handsome is as handsome does;'
and I should like to know who does all the work in the doll-house.
But speaking of witches, I wonder if Puff has ever heard the story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the witch who came to see little Polly Pemberton. That is a
queer story."</p>

<p>"No, I have never heard it, Mr. Moonman!" cried Puff eagerly.
"Was it a real witch? do tell me the story!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs112.png" width="450" height="278" alt="Telling a story to her brothers and sisters" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh! as for being real," I replied, "that is none of my business.
My business is to tell the story which I will do. I heard a little girl
in New Haven, telling it to her brothers and sisters the other night,
and she frightened them half out of their wits. I will try to tell the
story just as she did. Did you know, children, that there were
witches in old times? well, there were, or people thought there were,
which came to much the same thing for the witches. Hear this
story, and then see what you think about the matter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/gs113.png" width="389" height="500" alt="POLLY PEMBERTON." title="" />
<span class="caption">POLLY PEMBERTON.</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, once there was a little girl, about eight years old. I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
call her Polly, but you need not feel obliged to follow my example.
If you prefer to call her Kamschatka, I don't mind in the least.
This little girl lived with her father and mother, in a little red cottage
which stood quite by itself near a thick wood. Every day her
parents went to the village, which was a mile or more away, to work,
and they left little Polly in charge of the house, for she was a good
and quiet little girl, and never was lonely or sad. One day Polly was
sitting by the window, knitting, when she saw a queer-looking old
woman coming along the road; such a queer old woman. Have you
ever seen a picture of Cinderella's fairy godmother? well, she looked
just like that, pointed hat, red cloak, and all. When the old woman
saw Polly, she stopped, and looked earnestly at her; then she hobbled
slowly up to the door and knocked. Polly ran and opened the
door. "How are you, my child?" said the old dame; "let me
in. I'm your grandmother." Polly had always been taught to be
respectful to old people, so she let the old woman in, and politely
handed her a chair; but she could not help saying, as she did so,
"excuse me, ma'am, but I don't think you can be my grandmother."
"That shows how much you know about it!" replied the old woman;
"how old are you?" "Eight years old," said Polly. "Very
well!" said the old woman; "now I am ninety-six years old, just
twelve times as old as you are; therefore, I'm your grandmother."
"But I don't see&mdash;&mdash;" began Polly. "Oh, if you want to argue about
it," said the old dame, "here we are," and she drew from her
pocket a small book, and opening it, read aloud, "Take a little girl
eight years old, and multiply her by twelve; what will be the result?
Answer: her grandmother. There!" she said, triumphantly, "what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
do you think of that?" Poor Polly did not know what to think of
it. She looked at the book, which looked exactly like Colburn's
Arithmetic. "<i>Is</i> that Colburn's Arithmetic, ma'am?" she asked
timidly. "Colburn's Fiddlestick!" said the old woman, shortly.
"Here's another for you. Put a boy up an apple-tree, and divide
him by a good sized bull-dog; what will remain? hey?" "I'm
sure I don't know," said poor Polly, faintly. "Mince-meat, of
course," said the old woman. "You don't know much, evidently."
"What a dreadful looking cat!" thought Polly. And indeed, he did
not look like an amiable animal. His green eyes shone with an uncanny
light, and his long claws were constantly sheathing and
unsheathing themselves, as if they longed to scratch somebody.
However, the old woman certainly seemed fond of him. "Hobble-gobble!"
she said, "prince of cats, black diamond, blazing emerald,
attend!</p>

<div class='poem'>
Kickery punk, punkery kick,<br />
Bring the teapot and be quick!"<br />
</div>

<p>The cat gave one spring, and in the twinkling of an eye he
reached the cupboard where the silver was kept. Now the door of
the cupboard was locked, as Polly, in her surprise, (which was fast
turning into terror,) thankfully remembered. The cat, finding it
locked, turned and looked at his mistress, who, striking her stick on
the floor, exclaimed</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Scratchery, patchery, tooth and nail;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Open the door with a quirk of your tail."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Quick as thought the creature turned round and inserted the tip
of his tail in the key hole. In a moment the door flew open, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
seizing the silver teapot in his claws, the cat sprang back with it to
his mistress, who, snatching the teapot, hid it under her red cloak.
At this Polly sprang to her feet, with a cry of mingled fear and
anger; but the witch (for this certainly must have been a witch, if
ever there was one,) pointed her stick at her, and muttered some
strange words which sounded like "Buggara wuggera boogle jum,
Hobble-gobble!" She said this last word suddenly and sharply,
and Polly was quite startled; but fancy her alarm when a large black
cat crept out from beneath the red cloak, and sitting down on his mistress's
knee, looked up in her face with an air of unearthly sagacity,
and poor Polly fell back in her chair, unable to move hand or foot.
There she sat, motionless, but perfectly conscious, watching this
dreadful old hag. And what do you think the creature did next?
She took some strange looking herbs from her pocket, and put them
in the teapot, which she then filled with water and set on the stove.
Then, calling to her cat, she began to hop slowly round the stove on
one foot. The cat followed her, hopping first on one black foot and
then on another, but keeping its unearthly green eyes fixed on Polly
all the time. The witch kept muttering strange words like those
which had thrown the spell on Polly; while her companion moved
in time if not in tune.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Buggara wuggara, boogle jum jum!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I will have all, and my cat shall have some.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Boogle jum! boogle jmm! buggara boom!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down with the teapot and up with the broom!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"By the time she had hopped round the stove six times, the water
in the teapot was boiling furiously. The old hag stopped and said
"Hobble gobble, prince of cats, produce the broom-stick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cat jumped up on the stove, without seeming to mind the
heat in the least, though the iron was nearly red hot. He lifted the
lid of the teapot, and took out&mdash;what do you think, now? You
will never believe me, but I am not responsible for the story. He
took out&mdash;a broom. A long broom, with a bright red handle, which
seemed somehow as if it was alive, for it actually wriggled as the cat,
leaping down from the stove, handed it to his mistress. The old
woman snatched it, and waved it three times round Polly's head.
Then she mounted the stick as if it were a horse, and calling once
more to her cat, she rose in the air, and vanished up the chimney,
the cat sitting beside her on the broom-stick, and grinning hideously
at Polly as long as he remained in sight. That was truly dreadful,
was it not? that comes of leaving little girls alone all day, which is
a very bad plan."</p>

<p>"But is that all?" asked Puffy. "Doesn't it tell what became of
Polly, and the teapot? You haven't told any end to the story, Mr.
Moonman."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" I replied. "There isn't any end to it. But there is
an end to this night, and that end has come. Farewell, my mouse,
till to-morrow night."</p>

<p>And I whisked away, leaving Katinka and Puff so much astonished
that one fell off the bed, and the other woke up. Wasn't that funny?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>FOLLOWING A SUNBEAM.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/gs114.png" width="212" height="400" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><span class="smcap">untie</span>," said Downy, one morning, "I'v
dere any people in de fun?"</div>

<p>"In the fun, dear child?" answered
Mrs. Wilton. "What do you mean?
people are often in fun. Is that it?"</p>


<p>"Oh! no, Auntie!" said Fluff, who
was sitting beside Downy on the broad
window-sill, eating her porridge, "I
know what he means. He means 'in the
sun,' but he cannot say 's,' you know, so
he says 'f' instead."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Aunt Grace. "In the
sun; of course. I understand now.
Well, Downy boy, I have never been in
the sun, so I really cannot tell you. I
heard of a little boy who did go once, however. Fluffy, tell Downy
the little story I told you the other day, about the sunbeam. I
would tell it to him myself, but I must speak to cook about dinner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/gs115.png" width="351" height="350" alt="SItting by the window" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, Downy," said Fluff, in an important tone, as she settled
herself more comfortably on the window-sill, "Once upon a time
there was a little boy, and his name was Wynkyn."</p>

<p>"Nebber heard dat name!" interrupted Downy.</p>


<p>"Well, it was his name just the same," said Fluff, "for Auntie
said so. So he wanted to
know what was in the sun.
So somebody told him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whobody was it?"
inquired Downy.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/gs116.png" width="217" height="300" alt="Running after" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh! I don't know!
anybody!" said Fluff. "I
wont tell it if you interrupt
me, Downy."</p>

<p>"I wont adain!" said
Downy. "Do on, Fluffy!"</p>

<p>"Somebody told him," continued Fluff, "that if he put his foot on
the end of a sunbeam, it would turn into a golden ladder and lead
to the sun. So he did, and so it did,&mdash;turned into a ladder, I mean;
all shining gold, going right up into the sun. So he went up, and
up, and up, and the upper he went the brighter the ladder grew. At
last he came to the sun, and there were ever so many little boys and
girls, all made of gold, running about and playing, and having a
splendid time. And they all came and played with Wynkyn, and
gave him all sorts of lovely presents to take back to the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
A golden hat and a golden coat,<br />
A golden ball and a golden boat,<br />
A slate all covered with golden sums,<br />
And a golden pudding with diamond plums.<br />
</div>

<p>So he was very happy, and thought he would stay there all his
life. But while he was running after
one of the little golden boys, he tumbled
off the sun, and fell down the ladder,
turning somersaults all the way. And
when he came down to the earth again
he had lost all the presents except the
pudding, but he had held that all the way
down. So he sold it to a man for forty
million hundred dollars; and then he
was so rich that they made him King of
Siam, and he rode on a white elephant
with pink ears all the rest of his life."</p>

<p>"Iv dat all?" asked Downy.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all," replied Fluff. "I made up the last part of it,
because I couldn't remember just what Auntie told me after he came
down the ladder. And now, Downy, pet," she continued, "I must
go, for old Margaret has promised to show me the new chickens.
Finish your porridge, and then you can come too!" and away ran
Fluff, leaving the Downy mouse alone, looking very thoughtful over
his porringer. He was silent for some time; then laying down his
spoon, he said with an air of decision, "I'm doin' to do!" With
that, he slid down from the window sill, and trotted out of the house
as fast as his little fat legs would carry him. I knew perfectly well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that his intention was to go up to the sun, but I did not think he
would get very far. On the lawn he paused, and looked about him.
Plenty of sunbeams there; every blade of grass had one, for the
little sparklers, who are very vain, had come to look at themselves
and admire their own brightness in the drops of dew which lay on
every leaf and flower and spear of grass. Downy ran here and
there, putting his foot down wherever he saw a flash, and then looking
expectantly up into the air. But no golden ladder appeared, and
at length I heard the little mouse say, "Deve ivn't de right kind of
funbeamv. I'll do fomewhere elfe." So off he went, pattering over
the grass and over the gravel paths, still stamping on every spot of
sunshine, and still looking up for the golden ladder. I was just
beginning to think it was time some one came to look after the
mouse, when I heard a loud scream from the farm-yard. Turning
my eyes in that direction, I saw something that was really shocking.</p>

<p>Fluff had gone, as you know, with old Margaret, Mrs. Wilton's
good housekeeper, to see a new brood of chickens which had just
been hatched. They were the prettiest little downy things in the
world, and Fluff's happiness was complete when Margaret put them
all in her apron, and told her she might carry them to the new coop
which had just been made for them and their mother. Now Billy,
the donkey, was in the shed, by which Fluff was standing, and for
some minutes he had been looking out of the window, deeply interested
in my mouse's straw bonnet. Was it good to eat, or was it
not? that was the question which was agitating Billy's mind at that
moment. On the whole, he thought the only way to decide the
matter was to try it; so stretching his head quietly out of the window,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he seized the bonnet in his teeth, and tearing it from Fluff's
head, he proceeded to chew it as calmly as if it had been a wisp of
hay instead of a Tuscan straw. It was Fluff's scream that I heard,
and I found the little mouse overcome with grief at the loss of her
bonnet, the last fragment of which was just disappearing between
Billy's capacious jaws.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/gs117.png" width="378" height="425" alt="Gathering chickens" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Never mind, Miss Fluffy, dear!" said Margaret, soothingly;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
"come in to Auntie with me, and we'll tell her all about it. She'll
buy you a new bonnet, I promise you, or make you one out of
Master Billy's ears."</p>

<p>So they went into the house, after putting the chickens carefully
in their coop, and told Mrs. Wilton about the sad misfortune. Aunt
Grace could not help laughing at first; but she comforted Fluff, who
was really very much cast down, and promised to make her the
prettiest bonnet that heart could desire.</p>

<p>"But where is Downy?" she asked; "did you leave him in the
farm-yard, Margaret?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/gs118.png" width="230" height="300" alt="Hugging" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Sure, ma'am, I have not seen the child this morning!" said
Margaret.</p>

<p>"Why, I left him in the dining-room,
finishing his porridge!" exclaimed
Fluff. "Isn't he there now, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Mrs. Wilton. "He
is not anywhere in the house, and I
thought he had gone with you. Where
can the child be?"</p>

<p>Then there was a great hurry-scurry,
in the house and out of it. All the
other children were summoned, but
none of them had seen Downy: so they all started off to look
for him, Mrs. Wilton and Margaret, Nibble and Brighteyes, Fluff
and Roger, all going in different directions, and callings as they went:
"Downy! Downy boy! where are you, Downy?" but no Downy
answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>If people only knew a little more, how much better they would get
on! at every step the children might have found out where Downy
was, if they had only taken the
trouble to listen. The old Drake
quacked to them in his loudest
tones: "down by the brook!
down by the brook! stupid creatures!
down by the brook!" the
fir-trees on the lawn pointed
their long green fingers towards
the brook. The birds sang, the
dogs barked, the leaves whispered, the hens cackled, and each
and all said the same thing, over and over again! "Down by the
brook! down by the brook!" and so the whole family looked
on the beach, and in the orchard, and up and down the road, and all
over the barn and the stable, and in the pig-sty. If you will believe
me, it was not till after a two-hour's hunt that they found the
little fellow, curled up in the long grass by the side of the brook,
fast asleep.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>You may imagine how Aunt Grace caught him up, and kissed and
petted and scolded him all in a breath. But Downy struggled to get
down, and cried out "Don't take my foot off! don't take my foot off!
naughty Auntie! a-a-a-ah! a-a-ah!"</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" said his aunt. "Wake up, Downy dear! you
have been asleep, and we all thought you were lost, and were
dreadfully frightened about you. What is the matter with your foot,
my precious?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Downy rubbed his eyes and looked about him, seeming very much
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, where'v ve ladder?" he asked. "And where'v my dolden
puddin? I didn't want to tome down from de fun! a-a-a-ah! I want
to be de King of Fiam, and wide on a white elephant!"</p>

<p>Well, they all told him he had been asleep and dreaming; and
they petted and consoled him, and took him into the house, and
Aunt Grace gave him an apple almost as big as his own head. But
all day long Downy was very melancholy. He smarted under a
sense of injury, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'conld'">could</ins> not forgive his aunt for taking his foot off
the ladder; and it was many a day before he forgot the golden
pudding and the white elephant.</p>

<h3><span style="margin-left: 12em;">UNDER THE SEA.</span></h3>

<div class='blockquot8'><p><span class="smcap">The</span> four mice had been settled
at Glenwood for more than
two weeks before I was able to
pay them one of my evening
visits. Little Puff had been
very ill indeed, and all my spare
time had been devoted to her.
Besides this, there was a revolution
in Meteoria (the place
where the meteors come from,
my dears), and numbers of the
inhabitants had emigrated, and
had been whizzing past my
palace constantly, requiring my
utmost care to prevent it from
catching fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>But the revolution was over in a week, and about the same time
Puff began to be a little better. Then she went on improving so
fast that I thought I really must go and tell her brothers and sisters
about it. So off to Glenwood I went one fine night, where I was
greeted, as usual, with a chorus of delight.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Moonman!" cried Fluff, clapping her hands. "And
we thought he didn't know the way here! How <i>did</i> you know where
to find us, Mr. Moonman, dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, if you come to that," I replied, "there are very few places
in the world that I cannot find, and Glenwood is not a very hard one
to discover, my mouse. Now I have good news for you. I have
just come from Puff's nursery; she sends her love to you all, and
says she is nearly well, and wants to know what you have been doing
all this time."</p></div></td>
</tr></table></div>

<p>Then rose a clamor of questions from all sides, which I answered
as best I could. Yes, she sat up every day, and she had broiled
chicken for dinner, and dip-toast for supper, and Uncle Jack had
given her a lovely new doll, with flaxen hair curling all over her
head, whose name was Scarlatina Clematis Alfarata; but Puff called
her Tina, "for short."</p>

<p>"Did I know that Downy had been ill?" Brighteyes asked.</p>

<p>"No I did not know it! What had been the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it wasn't much!" broke in Nibble: "I don't see why they
made such a fuss about it. I made a feast for him, because Aunt
Grace wanted me to amuse him while she gave Brighteyes her
French lesson; and I cooked the feast in Roger's little stove, and
some of the black paint got into the food and made it disagree with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
him. Things are always disagreeing with people; I don't see why.
People eat oil, and I don't see why they shouldn't eat paint; there's
a great deal of oil in paint, Uncle Jack told me so."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs121.png" width="450" height="350" alt="Feasting" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well," I said, "you might spread paint instead of butter on your
bread, and see how you like it. Personally, I am inclined to take
Downy's view of the matter. But now, we must not stop too long,
for we have a long way to go to-night. I am going to fulfil my
promise at last, and take you to see Patty! What do you say to
that, all four of you?"</p>

<p>The mice did not say much that was intelligible, but their shrieks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of delight, their jumping and clapping of hands, were quite satisfactory.
The big cloud was waiting outside, and the seven Winds
were there, too, impatient for a frolic; so I tumbled my mice and
their cousin mouse out of their beds and into their soft white carriage,
and away we all went post-haste, or rather comet-haste, for it
is a long way to the Indian Ocean. Merrily puffed the winds, and
merrily chattered the five little ones; we told stories, and sang songs,
and altogether the trip was made so quickly that we were almost
sorry to hear the Winds talking Hindostanee to the waves of the
great silent water over which we were sweeping. Down floated the
cloud, down and down, until it rested lightly on a bit of smooth
sandy beach.</p>

<p>"Out with you, mice of mine!" I said. So the mice tumbled out
of the cloud again, and looked about them in much amazement and
some terror.</p>

<p>"I fink I'm afraid!" said Downy to me, confidentially.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" I replied. "You are not afraid. You are delighted,
my dear, but you are delighted in Hindostanee, and that may be a
different sensation from being delighted in English."</p>

<p>This explanation seemed to comfort the little fellow, so I turned to
the elder mice and said, "Patty is expecting you to-night, so everything
will be in readiness. All you have to do is to go out on that
flat rock yonder, and wait till a fish comes and speaks to you. Then
you must say&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Bobbily Bungaloo, Indian fish.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To visit your mistress is what I wish.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"After that he will manage everything for you, and will take you at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
once to Patty. I shall wait here till you return, for going under the
water is very apt to give
me the asthma. Run,
now, and be good, all of
you!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs122.png" width="400" height="624" alt="Walking" title="" />
</div>

<p>It required some courage
for the little ones to
leave their old friend
and start off on such a strange and out-of-the-way
expedition; but Nibble and
Brighteyes led the way boldly, and the
three others followed, clinging closely to
each other. They soon reached the rock,
and found Bobbily Bungaloo swimming
about, waiting for them. He greeted
them kindly, and bade them follow him,
and one by one they all disappeared
under the water.</p>

<p>Of course, however, I can see perfectly
well what goes on under the water. Dear
me, yes! it would be a pity if I could not
do that. I saw the mice go down, down,
down, through the clear water. All around them swam myriads of
fishes, all eager to greet the little strangers who had come so far.
There were large fishes and small fishes, some all head and some all
tail, some ugly enough to frighten one, and others so beautiful that
the children were sorely tempted to catch them and carry them home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
All were kind and friendly, and said many pleasant things, which
Bobbily Bungaloo, who is a very learned fish, translated into English
for the mice's benefit. At length they arrived at the bottom of the
sea, and saw at a little distance before them, the palace of my cousin
Patty. As I may have told you before, this palace is simply a huge
round pearl, hollowed out into many chambers. A more superb
dwelling-place can hardly be imagined. It is really like a small moon
under the water, so bright and beautiful is it. The children were
speechless with admiration
and wonder, as
they well might be.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/gs123.png" width="350" height="246" alt="Pearl" title="" />
</div>

<p>"H'm!" said a fat
oyster, opening her
shell to peep at them,
"I should think they
had never seen a pearl
before. My necklace
also is worth looking
at, if they only knew enough to look down."</p>

<p>But the mice had no eyes for anything except the pearl palace,
especially as Patty herself now appeared in the doorway, waiting to
welcome her little guests.</p>

<p>She kissed them all, and led them into a great hall, the walls and
ceiling of which were of mother-of-pearl, while the floor was of pink
coral, laid in a hundred beautiful patterns. At one end of the hall
was a throne of pearl, and on this Patty seated herself, bidding the
children sit down on some pretty pink coral stools beside her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my dears," she said, "what shall Patty do to amuse her
little friends? I think we will have some lunch first, for you must
be hungry after your long journey. Then I will take you through
the palace, and then you shall sail in one of my pretty boats. How
does that programme please you?"</p>

<p>She rang a bell, and a tall merman in a splendid livery, glistening
with pearl buttons, made his appearance, carrying a huge silver tray
heaped with sea-delicacies. The children were really hungry, and
they soon found that the dishes were as good as they were strange.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> this, Patty?" asked Brighteyes; "it is delicious, but I
cannot imagine what it is."</p>

<p>"That," said Patty, "is a fricassee of sea-anemones. They are
very nice, I think, and we cook them in a great many different ways.
Nibble, there, is eating fried gold-fish, and Fluff and Roger are busy
over a dish of scallops in jelly."</p>

<p>"Oh! how nice everything is!" sighed Fluff; "I wish I knew
whether it were all real or not. Mr. Moonman always laughs at me
when I ask him if I am dreaming him and all the good times we
have with him. Are you real, Patty? do tell me!"</p>

<p>But Patty only laughed and said, "I am as real as a great many
things in this world, dear child! Take some anemones, and don't
trouble yourself about their being real, as long as they are good."</p>

<p>When the children had finished their lunch, she took Downy by
the hand, and bade the rest follow her: and then she led them
through the different rooms of the wonderful palace. Dear! dear!
such a palace as it was! I really thought those mice would never
get their mouths shut again, so wide did they open them in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
amazement. The first room they went through was hung with green
sea-weed, beautifully fringed, and the carpet was of softest moss.
Here were sitting numbers of pretty mermaids, sewing and embroidering
on great pieces of kelp, with needles made of the spines
of some fish. They all nodded and smiled at the children, but did
not speak, for they knew nothing but Hindostanee.</p>

<p>"To think," murmured Brighteyes, softly, "that we should really
be in the same room with a dozen mermaids! and their neat little
tails <i>are</i> covered with scales, just as the song says, and they are sitting
in pink coral chairs. Oh! if I could only find out where the
sea-flower grows, so that I might remember all this!"</p>

<p>Then they passed through halls of deep-red coral, and lovely little
rooms which seemed entirely made of small bright shells set closely
together, until they came to the Sun and Moon rooms, which my
good Patty has named in honor of my brother and me. The Sun
room is all gold from floor to ceiling, burnished gold, which shines
so that one really has to shade one's eyes on going into it. From
the glittering ceiling hang numbers of diamond lamps, which swing
perpetually to and fro with a slow, steady motion, flashing and
sparkling like real sunbeams. My room, which is next to this
gorgeous apartment, is no less beautiful, being all of fretted silver,
with lamps of pearl, which shed a lovely soft light nearly equal to
that of my own beams, though not so bright. Of course the mice
were enchanted beyond measure with all this splendor; but when
they begged to be allowed to stay in the lovely silver room and play,
Patty smiled and said, "we have yet many things to see, dear children,
and the night is short. Besides, puss-in-the-corner is no better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
fun in a silver room than in a plastered nursery. Come then, and
see the play-room of my little mermaids!"</p>

<p>She threw open a door, and there was a sight which made the
mice fairly squeak with amazement and delight. It was a vast room,
all of white coral, with lovely pictures painted on the walls and
ceiling, and as full as it could be of little tiny sea-children, frolicking
about, and playing just as many pranks as land-babies play. They
surrounded the children with exclamations of wonder and delight.
Children must have a language of their own, certainly, for though
the Indian sea-babies knew no more of English than the American
babies did of Hindostanee, it was not ten minutes before they were
all perfectly good friends, and were playing together in the most delightful
way. Nibble and Roger were almost breaking their necks in
the vain endeavor to turn somersaults as fast as their little friends
with the tails. Brighteyes was hugging and petting "the loveliest
baby in the world, if it <i>hasn't</i> any toes," which she had taken from
its nurse's arms, while Fluff and a little mermaiden of her own age
were deeply confidential in a corner, on the subject of their respective
dolls. Fancy, will you, children all, a white coral doll with a
long pearly tail, and hair of pale yellow sea moss, very fine and soft!
Truly, it was a lovely creature, and Fluff would gladly have exchanged
the most cherished of her waxen babies for it. The little mermaid
sang pretty songs to her dolly, and rocked it in a cradle of amber
with sea-weed curtains. Presently Patty said, "Little Fluff, will you
not sing an English song for my sea-babies? sing something about
flowers and fairies, for those are things that we have not here, and
the little ones like to hear about them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>So my Fluff sang this little song, which she called "The Fairy
Wedding:"</p>

<img src="images/gs125.png" width="271" height="300" alt="Old Mr Moss" title="" />
</div>

<p>Loud were the cries of delight over
Fluffy's song; but they soon changed
into exclamations of sorrow, when
Patty told the mice that they must bid good-bye to their little sea
friends, as it was nearly time for them to go home. All the little
sea-maidens and boys pressed round them, kissing them, and begging
them to come again, which they gladly promised to do. Fluffy
hugged her new friend and said "good-bye, you dear! I think you
<i>must</i> be real, you are so lovely!" and so they left the beautiful play-room,
and the coral doors shut behind them.</p>

<p>At the gate of the palace they found a lovely boat waiting for
them. It was a great purple mussel-shell, lined with pearl, and
cushioned with softest moss. In this Patty told the mice to seat
themselves, and then, kissing them all, she bade them good-bye, and
touched the shell with her silver wand. Up floated the strange boat,
up and up, while the children leaned over the side as far as they
dared, and threw kisses to their "dear delightful lovely Patty!"
Multitudes of fishes surrounded them as before, and Bobbily Bungaloo,
as a guard of honor, swam before the boat. At last I, waiting
patiently by the rock, saw the five little heads rise above the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Lightly my pets jumped from their purple boat; they bade farewell
to Bobbily Bungaloo and his train, and then came running to me, all
talking at once, and so fast that their remarks sounded quite as much
like Hindostanee as like English.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "you shall tell me all about everything as we go
along; but we must start at once, for there is no time to be lost, I
assure you!"</p>

<p>So they wrapped themselves up in their cloud again, and the
Winds blew, and the children chattered, and the cloud flew through
the air at a tremendous rate. Indeed, our seven little airy friends
were so bent upon showing their utmost speed that they forgot where
they were going, and would have blown my mice to California if I
had not stopped them. As it was, it was nearly daybreak when we
reached Glenwood. The seven Winds were so weary that they did
not trouble themselves about the cloud after the children had got
out of it, but bidding the little ones farewell, they fell fast asleep in
the bed of lilies under the window; and I also departed, while my
pets called after me, thanking me for "the most delightful of all the
delightful nights!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>GOOD-BYE.</h3>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/gs126.png" width="450" height="295" alt="Tucked in" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, it was not long after this that my four mice went back to
the Mouse-trap, for Puffy was quite well again, and begged that she
might not be left alone a moment longer than was necessary. So
one happy day the little mouse, still pale and thin, but beaming with
delight, clasped her twin in her arms, on the old stone steps, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the other mice danced about them. Mrs. Posset cried over her
Downy; Tomty came up from the garden with his pockets full of
apples for his pets; Gruff and Grim and Grab barked their noisy
welcome; while good Uncle Jack smiled on them all, and was well-pleased
to have all his little ones around him again in the dear old
Mouse-trap.</p>

<p>And here, though it is really melancholy to think of, I must leave
my five mice. There are many and many more things that I should
like to tell you about them, but we must wait till another time for all
that. The fact is that Mr. Estes, the gentleman who is going to be
so very kind as to put all these stories into a book for me, (for
neither my dog nor I could possibly do that for ourselves, and I
don't know of any book-binding star in the whole firmament,) says
he really cannot undertake to print any more of my nonsense at
present, as he has many grave and learned books to publish. It is
my private opinion that there is often as much moonshine in grave
and learned books as there is in children's stories; but perhaps I am
not a good judge, for I see more or less moonshine in everything.</p>

<p>However that may be, the fact remains that I must say good-bye
for the present to the Five Mice in the Mouse-trap, and to you,
Patchko and Tinka, Jimmy and Jenny, Alice and Amy, and all the
rest of you. Be good children, now! don't forget to shut the door
after you when you go out of a room; don't forget to shut your eyes
when you go to sleep; and above all, don't forget your old friend,</p>
